<p>Tari is a community-driven project. The documents presented in this RFC collection have typically gone through several
iterations before reaching this point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideas and questions are posted in #tari-dev on <a href="https://freenode.net/">#FreeNode IRC</a>. This is typically short-form
content with rapid feedback. Often, these conversations will lead to someone posting an <a href="https://github.com/tari-project/tari/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3ARFC" title="Tari RFC Issues">issue</a> or RFC <a href="https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3ARFC" title="Tari RFC pull requests">pull request</a>.</li>
<li>RFCs are &quot;Requests for Comment&quot;, so although the proposals in these documents are usually well-thought out, they are
not cast in stone. RFCs can, and should, undergo further evaluation and discussion by the community. RFC comments are
best made using Github <a href="https://github.com/tari-project/tari/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3ARFC" title="Tari RFC Issues">issue</a>s.</li>
</ul>
<p>New RFC's should follow the format given in the <a href="RFC_template.html">RFC template</a>.</p>
<h2 id="lifecycle"><a class="header" href="#lifecycle">Lifecycle</a></h2>
<p>RFCs go through the following lifecycle, which roughly corresponds to the <a href="https://github.com/unprotocols/rfc/blob/master/2/README.md">COSS</a>:</p>

<h3 id="abstract"><a class="header" href="#abstract">Abstract</a></h3>
<p>The Tari network comprises two layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>A base layer that deals with <a href="Glossary.html#tari-coin">Tari coin</a> <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a>s. It governed by a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain that is merged-mined with
Monero. The base layer is highly secure, decentralized and relatively slow.</li>
<li>A digital assets network (DAN), consisting of multiple independent sidechains, that manage the state of the native digital assets.
It is built for liveness, speed and scalability at the expense of decentralization.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="theme/images/tari_network_overview.png" alt="Tari Network Overview" /></p>
<h3 id="currency-tokens-and-digital-assets"><a class="header" href="#currency-tokens-and-digital-assets">Currency Tokens and Digital Assets</a></h3>
<p>There are two major digital entities on the Tari network: the coins that are the unit of transfer for the Tari
cryptocurrency, and the digital assets that could represent anything from tickets to in-game items.</p>
<p>Tari coins are the fuel that drives the entire Tari ecosystem. They share many of the properties of money, so
security is a non-negotiable requirement. In a cryptocurrency context, this is usually achieved by employing a
decentralized network running a censorship-resistant protocol such as Nakamoto consensus over a proof-of-work blockchain.
As we know, PoW blockchains are not scalable or very fast.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Tari network will be used to create and manage digital assets.</p>
<p>In Tari parlance, a digital asset is defined as a finite set of digital stateful tokens that are governed by predefined
rules. A single digital asset may define anything from one to thousands of tokens within its scope.</p>
<p>For example, in a ticketing context, an <em>event</em> will be an asset. The asset definition will allocate tokens representing
the tickets for that event. The ticket tokens will have state, such as its current owner and whether or not it has been
redeemed. Users might be interacting with digital assets hundreds of times a second, and state updates need to be
propagated and agreed upon by the network very quickly. A blockchain-enabled ticketing system is practically useless if
a user has to wait for &quot;three block confirmations&quot; before the bouncer will let her into a venue. Users expect near-instant
state updates because centralized solutions offer them that today.</p>
<p>Therefore the Tari DAN must offer speed and scalability.</p>
<h4 id="multiple-layers"><a class="header" href="#multiple-layers">Multiple Layers</a></h4>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">distributed system trilemma</a> tells us that these requirements are
mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>We can't have fast, cheap digital assets and also highly secure and decentralized currency tokens on a single system.</p>
<p>Tari overcomes this constraint by building two layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>A base layer that provides a public ledger of Tari coin transactions, secured by PoW to maximize security.</li>
<li>A DAN consisting of multiple independent sidechains that each manage the state of a digital asset. It is very fast and cheap, at the expense of
decentralization.</li>
</ol>
<p>If required, the digital assets layer can refer back to the base layer to temporarily give up speed in exchange for
increased security. These commitments allow token owners to make attestations based on their asset state without relying completely on
the sidechain infrastructure. Furthermore, this link to the base layer can be used to resolve consensus issues on the digital assets
layer that may crop up from time to time as a result of the lower degree of decentralization.</p>
<h3 id="base-layer"><a class="header" href="#base-layer">Base Layer</a></h3>
<p><em>Refer to <a href="RFC-0100_BaseLayer.html">RFC-0100/BaseLayer</a> for more detail</em>.</p>
<p>The Tari base layer has the following primary features:</p>
<ul>
<li>PoW-based blockchain using Nakamoto consensus</li>
<li>Transactions and blocks based on the <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a> protocol</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a> is an exciting new blockchain protocol that offers some key advantages over other <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>-based
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transactions are private. This means that casual observers cannot ascertain the amounts being transferred or the
identities of the parties involved.</li>
<li>Mimblewimble employs a novel blockchain &quot;compression&quot; method called cut-through, which dramatically reduces the
storage requirements for blockchain nodes.</li>
<li>Multi-signature transactions can be easily aggregated, making such transactions very compact, and completely hiding
the parties involved, or the fact that there were multiple parties involved at all.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mimblewimble is the most sound, scalable 'base layer' protocol we know&quot; -- @fluffypony</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="proof-of-work"><a class="header" href="#proof-of-work">Proof of Work</a></h4>
<p>There are a few options for the PoW mechanism for Tari:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement an existing PoW mechanism. This is a bad idea, because a nascent cryptocurrency that uses a non-unique
mining algorithm is incredibly vulnerable to a 51% attack from miners from other currencies using the same algorithm.
Bitcoin Gold and Verge have already experienced this, and it's a <a href="https://www.crypto51.app/">matter of time</a> before it
happens to others.</li>
<li>Implement a unique PoW algorithm. This is a risky approach and comes close to breaking the number one rule of
cryptocurrency design: never roll your own crypto.</li>
<li><a href="https://tari-labs.github.io/tari-university/merged-mining/merged-mining-scene/MergedMiningIntroduction.html">Merged mining</a>.
This approach is not without its own risks, but offers the best trade-offs in terms of bootstrapping the network. It
typically provides high levels of hash rate from day one, along with 51% attack resistance, assuming mining pools are
well-distributed.</li>
<li>A hybrid approach, utilizing two or more of the above mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given Tari's relationship with Monero, a merged-mining strategy with Monero makes the most sense. However, the PoW mechanism
SHOULD be written in a way that makes it relatively easy to code, implement and switch to a different strategy in the
future. More information on Tari's current approach can be found in <a href="RFC-0131_Mining.html">RFC-0131_Mining</a>.</p>
<p>The mining strategy is explained more thoroughly in <a href="RFC-0130_Mining.html">RFC-130</a>.</p>
<h3 id="digital-assets-network"><a class="header" href="#digital-assets-network">Digital Assets Network</a></h3>
<p>A more detailed proposal for the DAN is presented in <a href="RFC-0300_DAN.html">RFC-0300/DAN</a>. Digital assets
<em>are discussed in more detail in <a href="RFC-0311_AssetTemplates.html">RFC-0310/Assets</a>.</em></p>
<p>The DAN is focused on achieving high speed and scalability, without compromising on security. To achieve
this we make the explicit trade-off of sacrificing decentralization. Generally, the primary parties that have a stake in the
security of a given digital asset are the Asset Issuer and Token owners. This fact points to a natural centralization of control
of an asset by the Asset Issuer.</p>
<p>Digital Assets consist of a set of tokens and their associated state. The state of an asset's tokens will be managed on a sidechain
that will run in parallel to the Tari base layer. The consensus mechanism, ledger style and other characteristics of the sidechain
will be chosen and managed by the Asset Issuer.</p>
<p>There are many options for the nature of these sidechains. These are still under discussion but it will be possible to run
multiple types of sidechains in the DAN and an Asset Issuer can choose which best suits the asset type it is supporting.</p>
<p>Please refer to Tari Labs University (TLU) for detailed discussions on
<a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/layer2scaling/layer2scaling-landscape/layer2scaling-survey.html">layer 2 scaling solutions</a>

<h3 id="interaction-between-base-layer-and-digital-assets-network"><a class="header" href="#interaction-between-base-layer-and-digital-assets-network">Interaction between Base Layer and Digital Assets Network</a></h3>
<p>The base layer provides supporting services to the DAN. In general, the base layer only knows about
Tari coin transactions. It knows nothing about the details of any digital assets and their state.</p>
<p>This is by design: the network cannot scale if details of digital asset contracts have to be tracked on the base layer.
We envisage that there could be tens of thousands of contracts deployed on Tari. Some of those contracts may be enormous;
imagine controlling every piece of inventory and their live statistics for a massively multiplayer online role-playing
game (MMORPG). The base layer is also too slow. If <em>any</em> state relies on base layer transactions being confirmed, there
is an immediate lag before that state change can be considered final, which kills the liveness properties we seek for the DAN.</p>
<p>It is better to keep the two networks almost totally decoupled from the outset, and allow each network to play to its
strength.</p>
<p>That said, there are key interactions between the two layers. The base layer is a ledger and can be used as a
source of truth for the DAN. Asset sidechains will periodically commit to their state on the base layer. These commitments
make it possible for token owners to make attestations about their tokens at certain points in time without relying on the
sidechain. These commitments can also be used as a final court of appeal in the case of consensus disputes.</p>
<p>The interplay between base layer and DAN is what incentivizes every actor in the system to maintain an efficient and
well-functioning network, even while acting in their own self-interest.</p>
<h3 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h3>

<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe and explain the Tari codebase layout.</p>

<p>The code follows a Domain-driven Design (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design" title="Wikipedia: Domain Driven Design">DDD</a>) layout, with top-level directories falling into infrastructure, domain
and application layers.</p>
<h3 id="infrastructure-layer"><a class="header" href="#infrastructure-layer">Infrastructure Layer</a></h3>
<p>The infrastructure layer provides a set of crates that have general infrastructural utility. The rest of the Tari codebase can make use
of these crates to obtain persistence, communication and cryptographic services. The infrastructure layer doesn't know
anything about blockchains, transactions or digital assets.</p>
<p>We recommend that code in this layer generalizes infrastructure services behind abstraction layers as much as is
reasonable, so that specific implementations can be swapped out with relative ease.</p>
<h3 id="domain-layer"><a class="header" href="#domain-layer">Domain Layer</a></h3>
<p>The domain layer houses the Tari &quot;business logic&quot;. All protocol-related concepts and procedures are defined and
implemented here.</p>
<p>This means that any and all terms defined in the <a href="../Glossary.html" title="Glossary">Glossary</a> will have a software implementation here, and only here.
They can be <em>used</em> in the application layer, but must be <em>implemented</em> in the domain layer.</p>
<p>The domain layer can make use of crates in the infrastructure layer to achieve its goals.</p>
<h3 id="application-layer"><a class="header" href="#application-layer">Application Layer</a></h3>
<p>In the application layer, applications build on top of the domain layer to produce the executable software that is
deployed as part of the Tari network.</p>
<p>As an example, the following base layer applications may be developed as part of the Tari protocol release:</p>
<ul>
<li>A base node executable (tari_base_node)</li>
<li>A Command Line Interface (CLI) wallet for the Tari cryptocurrency (tari_console_wallet)</li>
<li>A standalone miner (tari_mining_node)</li>
<li>A mining proxy to enable merge mining Monero (tari_merge_mining_proxy)</li>
<li>An Application Programming Interface (API) server for the base node (REST, gRPC, etc.)</li>

<p>The Tari Base Layer network comprises the following major pieces of software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Layer full node implementation. The base layer full nodes are the consensus-critical pieces of software for the
Tari base layer and cryptocurrency. The base nodes validate and transmit transactions and blocks, and maintain
consensus about the longest valid proof-of-work blockchain.</li>
<li>Mining software. Mining nodes perform proof-of-work to secure the base layer and compete to submit the
next valid block into the Tari blockchain. Tari uses two Proof of Work (PoW) algorithms, the first is merge-mined with Monero and a second native SHA3 PoW. 
The Tari source provides three alternatives for Tari miners:
<ul>
<li>A standalone miner for SHA3 mining</li>
<li>A merge-mining proxy to be used with XMRig to merge mine Tari with Monero</li>
<li>A stratum-compatible pool miner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wallet software. Client software and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offering means to construct transactions, query nodes for information and
maintain personal private keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three major pieces of software make use of common functionality provided by the following libraries within the Tari
project source code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local data storage</li>
<li>Cryptography services</li>
<li>Peer-to-peer networking and messaging services</li>

<p>Tari Base Nodes form a peer-to-peer network for a proof-of-work based blockchain running the <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a>
protocol. The proof-of-work is performed via hybrid mining, that is merge mining with Monero and stand-alone SHA 3. 
Arguments for this design are presented <a href="RFC-0001_overview.html#proof-of-work">in the overview</a>.</p>
<p>Tari Base Nodes MUST carry out the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>validate all <a href="Glossary.html#tari-coin">Tari coin</a> transactions;</li>
<li>propagate valid <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a>s to peer nodes;</li>
<li>validate all new <a href="Glossary.html#block">block</a>s received;</li>
<li>propagate validated new blocks to peer nodes;</li>
<li>connect to peer nodes to catch up (sync) with their blockchain state;</li>
<li>provide historical block information to peers that are syncing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the Digital Assets Network (DAN) goes live, Base Nodes will also need to support the tasks described in
<a href="RFC-0300_DAN.html">RFC-0300_DAN</a>. These requirements are omitted for the moment.</p>

<h4 id="blocktransaction-weight"><a class="header" href="#blocktransaction-weight">Block/Transaction Weight</a></h4>
<p>The weight of a transaction / block measured in &quot;grams&quot;. Input, output and kernel weights reflect their respective relative 
storage and computation cost. Transaction fees are typically proportional to a transaction body's total weight, creating 
incentive to reduce the size of the UTXO set.</p>
<p>Given the target block size of <code>S</code> and the choice for 1 gram to represent <code>N</code> bytes, we end up with
a maximum block weight of <code>S/N</code> grams. </p>
<p>To illustrate (these values should not be considered authoritative), with an <code>S</code> of 1MiB and <code>N</code> of 16, the block and 
transaction body weights are as follows:</p>
<p>|                   	| Byte size 	| Natural Weight         	| Adjust 	| Final                  	|

        output_weight += serialize(output.script) / BYTES_PER_GRAM

<h3 id="block-validation-and-propagation"><a class="header" href="#block-validation-and-propagation">Block Validation and Propagation</a></h3>
<p>The block validation and propagation process is analogous to that of transactions. New blocks are received from the 
peer-to-peer network, or from an API call if the Base Node is connected to a Miner.</p>
<p>When a new block is received, it is passed to the block validation service. The validation service checks that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The block has not been processed before.</li>
<li>Every <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> in the block is valid.</li>
<li>The proof-of-work is valid.</li>
<li>The block header is well-formed.</li>
<li>The block is being added to the chain with the highest accumulated proof-of-work.
<ul>
<li>It is possible for the chain to temporarily fork; Base Nodes SHOULD store orphaned forks up to some configured depth.</li>
<li>It is possible that blocks may be received out of order. Base Nodes SHOULD keep blocks that have block heights 
greater than the current chain tip for some preconfigured period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The sum of all excesses is a valid public key. This proves that:
$$ \Sigma \left( \mathrm{inputs} - \mathrm{outputs} - \mathrm{fees} \right) = 0$$. </li>
<li>That all kernel excess values are unique for that block and the entire chain.</li>
<li>Check if a block contains already spent outputs, reject that block.</li>
<li>The <a href="./RFC-0201_TariScript.html">Tari script</a> of every input must execute successfully and return the public key that signs the script signature.</li>
<li>The script offset \( \so\) is calculated and verified as per <a href="./RFC-0201_TariScript.html">RFC-0201_TariScript</a>. This prevents <a href="Glossary.html#cut-through">cut-through</a> from 
being applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because Mimblewimble blocks can simply be seen as large transactions with multiple inputs and outputs, the block 
validation service checks all transaction verification on the block as well.</p>
<p>Rejected blocks are dropped silently.</p>
<p>Base Nodes are not obliged to accept connections from any peer node on the network. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Nodes MAY refuse connections from peers that have been added to a denylist.</li>
<li>Base Nodes MAY be configured to exclusively connect to a given set of peer nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Validated blocks are</p>
<ul>
<li>added to the <a href="Glossary.html#blockchain">blockchain</a>;</li>
<li>forwarded to peers using the block <a href="Glossary.html#broadcaststrategy">BroadcastStrategy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, when a block has been validated and added to the blockchain:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mempool MUST also remove all transactions that are present in the newly validated block.</li>
<li>The UTXO set MUST be updated by removing all inputs in the block, and adding all the new outputs into it.</li>
</ul>

without notice.</p>
<p>This document may include preliminary concepts that may or may not be in the process of being developed by the Tari

<h2 id="goals-4"><a class="header" href="#goals-4">Goals</a></h2>
<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe the high-level Base Node architecture.</p>
<h2 id="architectural-layout"><a class="header" href="#architectural-layout">Architectural Layout</a></h2>
<p>The Base Node architecture is designed to be modular, robust and performant.</p>
<p><img src="theme/images/base_layer_arch.png" alt="Base Layer architecture" /></p>
<p>The major components are separated into separate modules. Each module exposes a public Application Programming Interface
(API), which communicates with other modules using asynchronous messages via futures.</p>
<h3 id="base-node-service"><a class="header" href="#base-node-service">Base Node Service</a></h3>
<p>The Base Node Service fields requests for the local nodes chain state and also accepts newly mined blocks that are 
propagating across the network. The service subscribes to NewBlock and BaseNodeRequest messages via the P2P comms 
interface. These messages are propagated across the P2P network and can also be received directly from other nodes. The 
service also provides a local interface to its functionality via an asynchronous Request-Response API. </p>
<p>The P2P message types this service subscribes to are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>NewBlock:</strong> A newly mined block is being propagated over the network. If the node has not seen the block before, the
node will validate it. Its action depends on the validation outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Invalid block</em> - drop the block.</li>
<li><em>Valid block appending to the longest chain</em> - add the block to the local state; propagate the block to peers.</li>
<li><em>Valid block forking off main chain</em> - add the block to the local state; propagate the block to peers.</li>
<li><em>Valid block building off unknown block</em> - add the orphan block to the local state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>BaseNodeServiceRequest:</strong> A collection of requests for chain data from the node.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="base-node-state-machine-service"><a class="header" href="#base-node-state-machine-service">Base Node State Machine Service</a></h3>
<p>This service is essentially a finite state machine that synchronises its blockchain state with its peers. When the state 
machine decides it needs to synchronize its chain state with a peer it uses the Base Node Sync RPC service to do so. The
RPC service allows for streaming of headers and blocks in a far more efficient manner than using the P2P messaging.</p>
<p>This service does not provide a local API but does provide an event stream and Status Info watch channel for other 
modules to subscribe to.</p>
<h3 id="mempool-and-mempool-sync-services"><a class="header" href="#mempool-and-mempool-sync-services">Mempool and Mempool Sync Services</a></h3>
<p>The mempool service tracks valid transactions that the node knows about, but that have not yet been included in a
block. The mempool is ephemeral and non-consensus critical, and as such may be a memory-only data structure. Maintaining
a large mempool is far more important for Base Nodes serving miners than those serving wallets. The mempool structure 
itself is a set of hash maps as described in <a href="RFC-0190_Mempool.html">RFC-0190</a></p>
<p>When the node reboots the Mempool sync service will contact peers and sync valid mempool transactions from them. After 
it has synced this service runs to field such requests from other peers.</p>
<p>The Mempool service handles Mempool Service Requests which it can receive from the P2P comms stack via its 
subscriptions, via the Mempool RPC service and via an internal Request-Response API. All these interfaces provide the 
following calls:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>SubmitTransaction</em>: Submit a transaction to be validated and included in the mempool. If the transaction is invalid 
it will be rejected with a reason.</li>
<li><em>GetTxStateByExcess</em>: Request the state of a transaction if it exists in the mempool using its excess signature</li>
<li><em>GetStats</em> and <em>getState</em>: Request information about the current status of the mempool.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="liveness-service"><a class="header" href="#liveness-service">Liveness Service</a></h3>
<p>The Liveness service can be used by other modules to test the liveness of a specific peer and also periodically tests a 
set of its connected peers for liveness. This service subscribes to <code>Ping</code> P2P messages and responds with <code>Pong</code>s. The 
service gathers data about the monitored peer's liveness such as its latency. The <code>Ping</code> and Pong` messages also contain
a copy of this nodes current Chain Metadata for use by the receiving nodes Chain Metadata Service.</p>
<h3 id="chain-metadata-service"><a class="header" href="#chain-metadata-service">Chain Metadata Service</a></h3>
<p>The Chain Metadata Service maintains this nodes current Chain Metadata state to be sent out via <code>Ping</code> and <code>Pong</code> 
messages by the Liveness service. This node also monitors the Chain Metadata received from other peers in the <code>Ping</code> and
<code>Pong</code> messages received by the Liveness service. Once a full round of <code>Pong</code> messages are received this service will 
emit this data as an event which the Base Node State Machine monitors.</p>
<h3 id="distributed-hash-table-dht-service"><a class="header" href="#distributed-hash-table-dht-service">Distributed Hash Table (DHT) Service</a></h3>
<p>Peer discovery is a key service that blockchain nodes provide so that the peer mesh network can be navigated by the full
nodes making up the network.</p>
<p>In Tari, the peer-to-peer network is not only used by full nodes (Base Nodes), but also by Validator Nodes, and</p>
<p>Tari and Digital Assets Network (DAN) clients.</p>
<p>For this reason, peer management is handled internally by the Comms layer. If a Base Node wants to propagate a message, 
new block or transaction, for example, it simply selects a <code>BROADCAST</code> strategy for the message and the Comms layer
will do the rest.</p>
<p>When a node wishes to query a peer for its peer list, this request will be handled by the <code>DHTService</code>. It will
communicate with its Comms module's Peer Manager, and provide that information to the peer.</p>
<h3 id="blockchain-database"><a class="header" href="#blockchain-database">Blockchain Database</a></h3>
<p>The blockchain database module is responsible for providing a persistent storage solution for blockchain state data. 
This module is used by the Base Node Service, Base Node State Machine, Mempool Service and the RPC servers. For Tari, 
this is delivered using the Lightning Memory-mapped Database (LMDB). LMDB is highly performant, intelligent and
straightforward to use. An LMDB is essentially treated as a hash map data structure that transparently handles
memory caching, disk Input/Output (I/O) and multi-threaded access. This module is shared by many services and so must
be thread-safe.</p>
<h2 id="communication-interfaces"><a class="header" href="#communication-interfaces">Communication Interfaces</a></h2>
<h3 id="p2p-communications"><a class="header" href="#p2p-communications">P2P communications</a></h3>
<p>The Tari Peer to Peer messaging protocol is defined in <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html">RFC-0172</a>. It is a fire-and-forget style protocol. Messages can 
be sent directly to a known peer, sent indirectly to an offline or unknown peer and broadcast to a set of peers. When
a message is sent to specific peer it is propagated to the peers local neighbourhood and stored by those peers until it
comes online to receive the message. Messages that are broadcast will be propagated around the network until the whole
network has received them, they are not stored.</p>
<h3 id="rpc-services"><a class="header" href="#rpc-services">RPC Services</a></h3>
<p>Fire-and-forget messaging is not efficient for point to point communications between online peers. For these applications
the Base Node provides RPC services that present an API for clients to interact with. These RPC services provide a
Request-Response interface defined by Profobuf for clients to use. RPC also allows for streaming of data which is much
more efficient when transferring large amounts of data.</p>
<p>Examples of RPC services running in 
Base Node are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wallet RPC service</strong>: An RPC interface containing methods used by wallets to submit and query transactions on a 
Base Node</li>
<li><strong>Base Node Sync RPC Service</strong>: Used by the Base Node State Machine Service to synchronize blocks</li>
<li><strong>Mempool RPC Service</strong>: Provides the Mempool Service API via RPC</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="grpc-interface"><a class="header" href="#grpc-interface">gRPC Interface</a></h3>
<p>Base Nodes need to provide a local communication interface in addition to the P2P and RPC communication interface. This 
is best achieved using <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>. The Base Node gRPC interface provides access to the public API methods of the Base Node
Service, the mempool module and the blockchain state module, as discussed above.</p>
<p>gRPC access is useful for tools such as local User Interfaces (UIs) to a running Base Node; client wallets running on
the same machine as the Base Node that want a more direct communication interface to the node than the P2P network
provides; third-party applications such as block explorers; and, of course, miners.</p>
<p>A non-exhaustive list of methods the base node module API will expose includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blockchain state calls, including:
<ul>
<li>checking whether a given Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) is in the current UTXO set;</li>
<li>requesting the latest block height;</li>
<li>requesting the total accumulated work on the longest chain;</li>
<li>requesting a specific block at a given height;</li>
<li>requesting the Merklish root commitment of the current UTXO set;</li>
<li>requesting a block header for a given height;</li>
<li>requesting the block header for the chain tip;</li>
<li>validating signatures for a given transaction kernel;</li>
<li>validating a new block without adding it to the state tree;</li>
<li>validating and adding a (validated) new block to the state, and informing of the result (orphaned, fork, reorg, etc.).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mempool calls
<ul>
<li>The number of unconfirmed transactions</li>
<li>Returning a list of transaction ranked by some criterion (of interest to miners)</li>
<li>The current size of the mempool (in transaction weight)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Block and transaction validation calls</li>
<li>Block synchronisation calls</li>

<p>The Future Time Limit. This is how far into the future a time is accepted as a valid time. Any time that is more than the FTL is rejected until such a time that it is not less than the FTL.

<p>Transaction inputs and outputs are sorted by their Pedersen commitment i.e. <code>\\(k \cdot G + v \cdot H\\)</code>. Specifically, the byte representation of the

<h2 id="description-5"><a class="header" href="#description-5">Description</a></h2>
<p>The following proposal draws from many of the key points of debate from the Tari community on the topic of Tari’s
main chain proof of work strategy. The early working assumption was that Tari would be 100% merged mined by Monero.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have a single, merge mined Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm, but the risks of hash rate attacks are 
real and meaningful. Double-spends and altering history can happen with &gt;50% hash power, while selfish mining and 
eclipse attacks can happen with &gt;33% hash power for a poorly connected attacker and &gt;25% for a well-connected attacker 
(see <a href="http://repositum.tuwien.ac.at/obvutwhs/download/pdf/2315652"><em>Merged Mining: Analysis of Effects and Implications</em></a>).
Any non-merge mined PoW algorithm that is currently employed is even more vulnerable, especially if one can simply buy
hash rate on platforms like NiceHash.</p>
<p>Hybrid mining is a strategy that apportions blocks across multiple PoW algorithms. If the hybrid algorithms are
independent, then one can get at most x% of the total hash rate, where x is the fraction of blocks apportioned to that
algorithm. As a result, the threat of a double-spend or selfish mining attack is mitigated, and in some cases
eliminated.</p>
<p>This proposal puts forward Hybrid mining as the Tari PoW algorithm. However, some details still needed to be decided:</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of algorithms;</li>
<li>the choice of algorithms;</li>
<li>the block distribution;</li>
<li>the difficulty adjustment strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-number-of-algorithms"><a class="header" href="#the-number-of-algorithms">The number of algorithms</a></h3>
<p>In hybrid mining, &quot;independence&quot; of algorithms is key. If the same mining hardware can be used on multiple PoW
algorithms in the hybrid mining scheme, you may as well not bother with hybrid mining, because miners can simply
switch between them.</p>
<p>In practice, no set of algorithms are truly independent. The best we can do is try to choose algorithms that work best
on CPUs, GPUs, and ASICs. In truth, the distinction between GPUs and ASICs is only a matter of time. Any &quot;GPU-friendly&quot;
algorithm is ASIC-friendly too; it's just a case of whether the capital outlay for fabricating them is worth it; and
this will eventually become true for any algorithm that supplies PoW for a growing market cap. Employing merged mining
with major players that use independent hardware introduces another degree of freedom, as long as those are independent,
like RandomX with Monero, SHA-256 with Bitcoin and Scrypt with Litecoin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Merge mining does not add security per se, but it does add plenty of hash rate and continuity of the blockchain.</em></p>
<p>So really the answer to how many algorithms is: More than one, as independent as possible.</p>
<h3 id="the-choice-of-algorithms"><a class="header" href="#the-choice-of-algorithms">The choice of algorithms</a></h3>
<p>A good technical choice would be merge mining with Monero, Bitcoin and Litecoin, if enough interest could be
attracted from those mining communities. However, that would rule out any participation from Tari supporters and
enthusiasts, at least in the early stages. So, to be inclusive of Tari supporters and enthusiasts, merge mining RandomX
with Monero and another GPU/ASIC-friendly algorithm, like SHA3 also known as Keccak, is proposed. Using a custom
configuration of such a simple and well understood algorithm means there is a low likelihood of unforeseen optimizations
that will give a single miner a huge advantage. It also means that it stands a good chance of being &quot;commoditized&quot; when 
ASICs are eventually manufactured. This means that SHA3 ASICs will be widely available and not available from only a 
single supplier.</p>
<p><em><strong>Edit:</strong> Handshake, which launched a few months ago, selected a Hashcash PoW algorithm
<a href="https://handshake.org/files/handshake.txt">(see #Consensus)</a> using SHA3 and Blake2B for many of the same reasons:
SHA3 is currently under-represented in PoW; SHA3 usage in combination with Blake2B in PoW creates a more level playing
field for hardware manufacturers.</em></p>
<h3 id="the-block-distribution"><a class="header" href="#the-block-distribution">The block distribution</a></h3>
<p>To reduce the chance of hash rate attacks, an even 50/50 distribution is needed, as discussed earlier. However,
sufficient buy-in is needed, especially with regards to merge mining RandomX with Monero. To make it worthwhile for a
Monero pool operator to merge mine Tari, but still guard against hash rate attacks and to be inclusive of independent
Tari supporters and enthusiasts, a 60/40 split is proposed in favour of merge mining RandomX with Monero. The
approaching <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/tail-emission.html">Monero tail emission</a> at the end of May
2022 should also make this a worthwhile proposal for Monero pool operators.</p>
<h3 id="the-difficulty-adjustment-strategy"><a class="header" href="#the-difficulty-adjustment-strategy">The difficulty adjustment strategy</a></h3>
<p>The choice of difficulty adjustment algorithm is important. In typical hybrid mining strategies, each algorithm operates
completely independently with a scaled-up target block time and is the most likely approach that any blockchain will
take. Tari testnet has been running very successfully on Linear Weighted Moving Average (LWMA) from Bitcoin &amp; Zcash
Clones <a href="https://github.com/zawy12/difficulty-algorithms/issues/3#issuecomment-442129791">version 2018-11-27</a>. This LWMA
difficulty adjustment algorithm has also been
<a href="https://github.com/tari-labs/modelling/tree/master/scenarios/multi_pow_01">tested in simulations</a> and it proved to be a
good choice in the multi-PoW scene as well.</p>
<h3 id="final-proposal-hybrid-mining-details"><a class="header" href="#final-proposal-hybrid-mining-details">Final proposal, hybrid mining details</a></h3>
<p>The final proposal is summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li>2x mining algorithms, with average combined target block time at 120 s, to match Monero's block interval</li>
<li>LWMA version 2018-11-27 difficulty algorithm adjustment for both with difficulty algo window of 90 blocks</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Tari employs a hybrid mining strategy, accepting 2 mining algorithms whose difficulties are independent of each other as discussed in <a href="/RFC-0131_Mining.html">RFC-0131_Mining.html</a>.
This RFC details a protocol to enable Tari to accept Monero proof of work, enabling participating miners a chance to produce a valid block for either or both chain without additional mining effort.</p>
<p>The protocol must enable a Tari base node to make the following assertions:</p>
<p><strong>REQ 1.</strong> The achieved mining difficulty exceeds target difficulty as dictated by Tari consensus, </p>
<p><strong>REQ 2.</strong> The Monero block was constructed after the current Tari tip block. This is to prevent a miner from submitting blocks from the parent chain that satisfy the auxiliary chain's difficulty without doing new work.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that a Tari base node never has to contact or download data from Monero to make these assertions.</p>
<h2 id="merge-mining-on-tari"><a class="header" href="#merge-mining-on-tari">Merge Mining on Tari</a></h2>
<p>A new Tari block template is obtained from a Tari base node by calling the <code>get_new_block_template</code> gRPC method, setting <code>Monero</code> as the chosen PoW algorithm.
The <code>Monero</code> algorithm must be selected so that the correct mining difficulty for the Monero algorithm is returned. Remember, that Monero and SHA difficulties 
are independent (See <a href="/RFC-0131_Mining.html">RFC-0131_Mining.html</a>). Next, a coinbase transaction is requested from a Tari Wallet for a give height by calling 
the <code>get_coinbase</code> gRPC function. </p>
<p>Next, the coinbase transaction is added to the new block template and passed back to the base node for the new MMR roots to be calculated.
Furthermore, the base node constructs a <em>Blake256</em> hash of <em>some</em> of the Tari header fields. We'll call this hash the merge mining hash \( h_m \) that commits to 
the following header fields in order: <code>version</code>, <code>height</code>,<code>prev_hash</code>,<code>timestamp</code>,<code>output_mr</code>,<code>range_proof_mr</code>,<code>output_mmr_size</code>,<code>kernel_mr</code>,
<code>kernel_mmr_size</code>,<code>total_kernel_offset</code>,<code>total_script_offset</code>. Note, this hash does not include the <code>pow</code> and <code>nonce</code> fields, as these fields are set as part of mining.</p>
<p>To have the chance of mining a Monero block as well as a Tari block, we must obtain a new valid monero block template, by calling <a href="https://ww.getmonero.org/resources/developer-guides/daemon-rpc.html#get_block_template">get_block_template</a>.
This returns a <code>blocktemplate_blob</code>, that is, a serialized Monero block containing the Monero block header, coinbase and a list of hashes referencing the 
transactions included in the block. Additionally, a <code>blockhashing_blob</code> is a fixed size blob containing <code>serialized_monero_header</code>, <code>merkle_tree_root</code> and 
<code>txn_count</code> concatenated together. The <code>merkle_tree_root</code> is a <em>merkle root</em> of the coinbase + the transaction hashes contained in the block.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub struct Block {
    /// The block header
    pub header: BlockHeader,
    /// Coinbase transaction a.k.a miner transaction
    pub miner_tx: Transaction,
    /// References to the transactions included in this block
    pub tx_hashes: Vec&lt;hash::Hash&gt;,
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>fig 1. The Monero block struct</em></p>
<p>Next, modify the Monero block template by including the merge mining hash \( h_m \) in the extra fields of the coinbase transaction. Monero has a <a href="https://docs.rs/monero/0.13.0/monero/blockdata/transaction/enum.SubField.html#variant.MergeMining">merge mining subfield</a> 
to accommodate this data. Importantly, the extra field data part of the coinbase transaction hash and therefore the <code>merkle_tree_root</code>, the <code>blockhashing_blob</code> must be 
reconstructed. A rust port of <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/monero/blob/1c8e598172bd2eddba2607cae0804db2e685813b/src/crypto/tree-hash.c">Monero's tree hash</a> algorithm is needed to achieve this. The coinbase hash MUST be the first element to be hashed when constructing the <code>merkle_tree_root</code>.
This satisfies <strong>REQ 2</strong>, proving that the proof-of-work was performed for the Tari block.</p>
<p>The block may now be mined. Once a solution is found that satisfies the Tari difficulty, the miner must include enough data to allow the Tari blockchain to assert <strong>REQ 1</strong> and <strong>REQ 2</strong>.
Concretely, A miner must serialize <code>MoneroPowData</code> using Monero consensus encoding and add it to the <code>pow_data</code> field in the Tari header.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub struct MoneroPowData {
    /// Monero header fields
    header: MoneroBlockHeader,
    /// randomX vm key
    randomx_key: FixedByteArray, // Fixed 64 bytes
    /// transaction count
    transaction_count: u16,
    /// transaction root
    transaction_root: Hash,
    /// Coinbase merkle proof hashes
    coinbase_merkle_proof: MerkleProof,
    /// Coinbase tx from Monero
    coinbase_tx: MoneroTransaction,
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>fig 2. Monero PoW data struct serialized in Tari blocks</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub struct MerkleProof {
   branch: Vec&lt;Hash&gt;,
   depth: u16,
   path: u32,
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>fig 3. Merkle proof struct</em></p>
<p>A verifier may now check that the <code>coinbase_tx</code> contains the merge mining hash \( h_m \), and validate the <code>coinbase_merkle_proof</code> against the <code>transaction_root</code>.
The <code>coinbase_merkle_proof</code> contains the minimal proof required to construct the <code>transaction_root</code>.</p>
<p>For example, a proof for a merkle tree of 4 hashes will require 2 hashes (h_1, h_23) of 32 bytes each, 4 bytes for the path bitmap and 2 bytes for the depth.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">           Root*
         /      \
       h_c1*     h_23
      /    \       
     h_c*     h_1
 
 * Not included in proof
</code></pre>
<h2 id="serialisation"><a class="header" href="#serialisation">Serialisation</a></h2>
<p>For Monero proof-of-work, Monero consensus encoding MUST be used to serialize the <code>MoneroPowData</code> struct. Given the same inputs, 
this encoding will byte-for-byte the same. The encoding uses VarInt for all integer types, allowing byte-savings, in particular
for fields that typically contain small values. Importantly, extra bytes that a miner <em>could</em> tack onto the end of the <code>pow_data</code> field
are expressly disallowed.</p>
<h2 id="merge-mining-proxy"><a class="header" href="#merge-mining-proxy">Merge Mining Proxy</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tari-project/tari/blob/development/applications/tari_merge_mining_proxy">Tari merge mining proxy</a> proxies the <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/resources/developer-guides/daemon-rpc.html">Monero daemon RPC</a> interface. It behaves as a middleware that implements the merge 
mining protocol detailed above. This allows existing Monero miners to merge mine with Tari without having to make changes 
to mining software. </p>
<p>The proxy must be configured to connect to a <code>monerod</code> instance, a Tari base node, and a Tari console wallet. Most requests
are forwarded &quot;as is&quot; to <code>monerod</code>, however some are intercepted and augmented before being returned to the miner.</p>
<h3 id="get_block_template"><a class="header" href="#get_block_template"><code>get_block_template</code></a></h3>
<p>Once <code>monerod</code> has provided the block template response, the proxy retrieves a Tari block template and coinbase, 
and assembles the Tari block. The merge mining hash \( h_m \) is generated and added to the Monero coinbase. The modified
<code>blockhashing_blob</code> and <code>blocktemplate_blob</code> are returned to the miner. The difficulty is set to <code>min(monero_difficulty, tari_difficulty)</code>
so that the miner submits the found block at either chain's difficulty. The Tari block template is cached for later submission.</p>
<h3 id="submit_block"><a class="header" href="#submit_block"><code>submit_block</code></a></h3>
<p>The miner submits a solved Monero block (at a difficulty of <code>min(monero_difficulty, tari_difficulty)</code>) to the proxy. The cached
Tari block is retrieved, enriched with the <code>MoneroPowData</code> struct and submitted to the Tari base node.</p>

<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe the syncing, seeding and pruning process.</p>

<h2 id="descriptions"><a class="header" href="#descriptions">Descriptions</a></h2>
<h3 id="syncing"><a class="header" href="#syncing">Syncing</a></h3>
<p>When a new node comes online, loses connection or encounters a chain reorganization that is longer than it can tolerate, 
it must enter syncing mode. This will allow it to recover its state to the newest up-to-date state. Syncing can be 
divided into two <a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstrategy">SynchronizationStrategy</a>s: complete sync and horizon sync. Complete sync means that the node 
communicates with an archive node to get the complete history of every single block from genesis block. Horizon Sync 
involves the node getting every block from its <a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a> to <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a>, as well as every block header 
up to the genesis block. </p>
<p>To determine if the node needs to synchronise the node will monitor the broadcast chain_metadata provided by its neighbours.</p>
<h4 id="complete-sync"><a class="header" href="#complete-sync">Complete Sync</a></h4>
<p>Complete sync is only available from archival nodes, as these will be the only nodes that will be able to supply the 
complete history required to sync every block with every transaction from genesis block up onto <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a>. </p>
<h4 id="complete-sync-process"><a class="header" href="#complete-sync-process">Complete Sync Process</a></h4>
<p>Once the base node has determined that it is lagging behind the network tip it will start to synchronise with the peer
it determines to have all the data required to synchronise.</p>
<p>The syncing process MUST be done in the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set <a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstate">SynchronizationState</a> to <code>header_sync</code>.</li>
<li>Sync all missing headers from the genesis block to the current chain tip. The initial header sync allows the node to
confirm that the syncing peer does indeed have a fully intact chain from which to sync that adheres to this node's
consensus rules and has a valid proof-of-work that is higher than any competing chains.</li>
<li>Set <a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstate">SynchronizationState</a> to <code>block_sync</code>.</li>
<li>Start downloading blocks from sync peer starting with the oldest block in our database. A fresh node will start from 
the genesis block.</li>
<li>Download all block up to <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a>, validating and adding the blocks to the local chain storage as we go.</li>
<li>Once all blocks have been downloaded up and including the current network tip set the <a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstate">SynchronizationState</a> to 
<code>listening</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>After this process, the node will be in sync, and will be able to process blocks and transactions normally as they 
arrive.</p>
<h4 id="horizon-sync-process"><a class="header" href="#horizon-sync-process">Horizon Sync Process</a></h4>
<p>The horizon sync process MUST be done in the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set <a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstate">SynchronizationState</a> to <code>header_sync</code>.</li>
<li>Sync all missing headers from the genesis block to the current chain tip. The initial header sync allows the node to
confirm that the syncing peer does indeed have a fully intact chain from which to sync that adheres to this nodes
consensus rules and has a valid proof-of-work that is higher than any competing chains.</li>
<li>Set <a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstate">SynchronizationState</a> to <code>horizon_sync</code>.</li>
<li>Download all kernels from the current network tip back to this node's <a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a>.</li>
<li>Validate kernel MMR root against headers.</li>
<li>Download all <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">utxo</a>'s from the current network tip back to this node's <a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a>.</li>
<li>Validate outputs and <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">utxo</a> MMR.</li>
<li>Validate the chain balances with the expect total emission that the final sync height.</li>
<li>Once all kernels and <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">utxo</a>s have been downloaded from the network tip back to this node's <a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a> set 
the <a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstate">SynchronizationState</a> to <code>block_sync</code>. This hands over further syncing to the standard sync protocol which 
should return to the <code>listening</code> state if no further data has been received from peers.</li>
</ol>
<p>After this process, the node will be in sync, and will be able to process blocks and transactions normally as they
arrive.</p>
<h4 id="keeping-in-sync"><a class="header" href="#keeping-in-sync">Keeping in Sync</a></h4>
<p>The node that is in the <code>listening</code> state SHOULD periodically test a subset of its peers with ping messages to ensure 
that they are alive. When a node sends a ping message, it MUST include the height of the current longest chain, current 
accumulated PoW difficulty, hash of the <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a>, it's pruning horizon and it's current pruned height. The 
receiving node MUST reply with a pong message, which should include it's version of the information contained within the
ping message.</p>
<p>When a node receives pong replies from the current ping round, or the timeout expires, the collected chain_metadata
replies will be examined to determine what the current best chain is, i.e. the chain with the most accumulated work.
If the best chain is longer than out chain data the node will set <a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstate">SynchronizationState</a> to <code>header_sync</code> and catch up
with the network.</p>
<h4 id="chain-forks"><a class="header" href="#chain-forks">Chain Forks</a></h4>
<p>Chain forks occur in all decentralized proof-of-work blockchains. When the local node is in the <code>listening</code> state it 
will detect that it has fallen behind other nodes in the network. It will then perform a header sync and during the 
header sync process will be able to detect that a chain fork has occurred. The header sync process will then determine
which chain is the correct chain with the highest accumulated work. If required this node will switch the best chain
and proceed to sync the new blocks required to catch up to the correct chain. This process is called a chain 
reorganization or <a href="Glossary.html#chain-reorg">reorg</a>. </p>
<h3 id="pruning"><a class="header" href="#pruning">Pruning</a></h3>
<p>In Mimblewimble, the state can be completely verified using the current <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a> set (which contains the output 
commitments and range proofs), the set of excess signatures (contained in the transaction kernels) and the PoW. The full
block and transaction history is not required. This allows base layer nodes to remove old spent inputs from the 
<a href="Glossary.html#blockchain">blockchain</a> storage. </p>
<p>Pruning is only for the benefit of the local Base Node, as it reduces the local blockchain size. Pruning only happens 
after the block is older than the <a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a> height. A Base Node will either run in archival mode or pruned mode.
If the Base Node is running in archive mode, it MUST NOT prune. </p>
<p>When running in pruning mode, <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">Base Node</a>s MUST remove all spent outputs that are older than the 
<a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a> in their current stored <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a> set when a new block is received from another <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">Base Node</a>.</p>

<p>This Request for Comment (RFC) describes the transaction protocol for peer-to-peer Tari payments using 
the Mimblewimble protocol. It also considers some attacks that may be launched against the protocol and offers some 
discussion around those attacks and potential alternatives to the protocol.</p>
<p>The goal is to describe a transaction protocol that:</p>
<ul>
<li>permits multiple recipients;</li>
<li>preserves privacy regarding how many parties are involved in the transaction; and</li>
<li>is secure against all reasonable attacks.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="description-7"><a class="header" href="#description-7">Description</a></h2>
<p>The Tari base layer is built using <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/grin-protocol-overview/MainReport.html" title="Mimblewimble on TLU">Mimblewimble</a>, which requires that all parties involved in a Tari transfer must interact
to construct a valid <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/mimblewimble-1/MainReport.html" title="Mimblewimble
transactions on TLU">Mimblewimble transaction</a>.</p>
<p>A valid transaction involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>a set of one or more inputs being spent by the Sender;</li>
<li>a set of zero or more outputs being sent to the Sender;</li>
<li>a set of recipients, each of whom MUST construct exactly one output; and</li>
<li>a set of partial Schnorr signatures which, when aggregated, validates the transaction construction and indicates every
party's satisfaction with the terms.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-issue-with-multiple-recipients"><a class="header" href="#the-issue-with-multiple-recipients">The Issue with Multiple Recipients</a></h3>
<p>Each party involved in a Tari transaction must produce a partial signature, signing the same challenge. This challenge is
defined as</p>
<p>$$ e = H(\Sigma R_i \Vert \Sigma P_i \Vert m) $$</p>
<p>where \(R_i\) are public nonces generated by each party for this signature; \(P_i\) are the public <a href="Glossary.html#spending-key">Spending Key</a>s;
and <em>m</em> is the additional metadata for the transaction. \(\Sigma P_i\) is the value of the (pre-offset) excess that is
stored in the transaction kernel.</p>
<p>Notice that every signing party needs to know the sum of all the nonces and public spending keys. This suggests that
every party knows how many parties are involved in the transaction, which is not an ideal privacy scenario. It would be
preferable if a secure scheme could be found where each recipient interacts only with the sender and does not need to
calculate these sums themselves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as discussed below, it seems that using any known scheme, it's not possible to satisfy this
privacy goal while achieving the desired security level.</p>
<h3 id="the-issue-with-multiple-senders"><a class="header" href="#the-issue-with-multiple-senders">The Issue with Multiple Senders</a></h3>
<p>To increase privacy, the public excess values are <a href="https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/master/doc/intro.md#kernel-offsets">offset</a> by a constant random value. The choice of this value, as well
as fee selection, can only be set once per transaction. The privilege of selecting these values is generally bestowed on
the sender, since the sender pays the fee. Allowing multiple sending parties (or equivalently, allowing recipients to provide
inputs) would require a negotiation round to set the fee and offset before the transaction could be constructed. This is
a complication we don't want to deal with, and so all schemes presented here allow exactly one sender.</p>
<h3 id="two-party-transactions"><a class="header" href="#two-party-transactions">Two-party Transactions</a></h3>
<p>Two-party transactions are fairly straightforward and are described in detail by Tari Labs University (TLU). (Refer to 
<a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/mimblewimble-1/MainReport.html" title="Mimblewimble
transactions on TLU">Mimblewimble Transaction</a>.)</p>
<p>It is proposed that Tari implement this single-round two-party transaction scheme as a special case to support both online
two-party transactions as well as &quot;offline&quot; transactions such as via email, text message and carrier pigeon.</p>

<h2 id="transaction-id"><a class="header" href="#transaction-id">Transaction ID</a></h2>
<p>The scheme above makes use of a <code>tx_id</code> field in every peer-to-peer message. Since all messages are stateless and
asynchronous, peers need some way of figuring out which message refers to which transaction. The transaction ID fulfils
this role.</p>
<p>The ID does not appear on the blockchain in any manner; is purely used to disambiguate Tari transaction messages and
can be discarded after the transaction is broadcast to the network.</p>
<p>The <code>tx_id</code> is unique for every receiver so that any observers of the communication will not be able to group receivers
together (however, the communication should be over secure channels in general).</p>
<p>The format of the transaction ID is a four-byte, little-endian integer (u64) and is
calculated as</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">H(Rs||i)[0..4]
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>i</code> is the i-th recipient in the transaction. The sender can use the <code>tx_id</code> as a hash map key to identify and
differentiate recipients.</p>
<h2 id="replay-attacks"><a class="header" href="#replay-attacks">Replay Attacks</a></h2>
<p>If any party can be convinced to sign a different message with the same nonce, its private keys will be lost. One way
of achieving this would be if a virtual machine could be &quot;snapshotted&quot; or otherwise cloned at any point between sharing
the public nonce and signing the message. Both copies of the victim's machine will now continue, unaware that there's a
copy participating in a signature round. What then happens is:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{align}
&amp;\text{Clone A} &amp; &amp;\text{Clone B} \\
e_1 &amp;= H(r_1 \Vert r_s \Vert \dots) &amp; e_2 &amp;= H(r_1 \Vert r_s^* \Vert \dots) \\
s_1 &amp;= r_1 + e_1 \cdot k_1 &amp; s_2 &amp;= r_1 + e_2 \cdot k_1 \\
\end{align}
$$</p>
<p>The attacker receives both signatures and trivially calculates the secret key:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{align}
\Delta s &amp;= s_1 - s_2 \\
&amp;= k_1(e_1 - e_2) = k_1\Delta e \\
\Rightarrow k_1 &amp;= \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta e}
\end{align}
$$</p>
<p>We've demonstrated this with the attacker changing their nonce, but literally any alteration to the challenge will provide
a new challenge \(e_2\), enabling the attack.</p>
<p>What can we do about this? In fact, it's not possible to eliminate this attack at all! The reason sits with the proof
that the Schnorr scheme works as a zero-knowledge protocol; the demonstration of this proof is precisely the attack
we're trying to avoid [<a href="https://medium.com/magicofc/interactive-proofs-and-zero-knowledge-b32f6c8d66c3" title="On Interactive Proofs and
Zero-Knowledge: A Primer [Section 3]">GOL19</a>]. If we could eliminate this attack, we'd need to come up with a completely different way
of proving the zero-knowledge property.</p>
<p>So we can't stop it, but we can make it as tricky as possible for the attacker to trick the receiver into replaying the
signature. MuSig does this by requiring parties to share the hash of their nonces beforehand. At its extreme: in the
two-party, single-round scheme, for example, the attacker would need to be able to control the victim's machine code
execution (like running a debugger), at which point one might think the attacker could read the private key directly
from memory anyway.</p>
<h2 id="rogue-key-attacks"><a class="header" href="#rogue-key-attacks">Rogue Key Attacks</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/digital_signatures/introduction_schnorr_signatures.html#key-cancellation-attack">Rogue Key attacks</a>
are another type of attack that can occur in multi-signature schemes.</p>
<p>In this case, the attacker has the freedom to choose a key or nonce <em>after</em> the victim has already disclosed theirs. This
may allow the attacker to forge a valid signature on behalf of the victim. A recent paper, [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/417.pdf" title="On the Security of Two-Round Multi-Signatures">DRI19</a>], suggests that
<em>any</em> Schnorr-based, two-round multi-signature scheme is vulnerable to a rogue key attack.</p>
<p>How this might apply in an insecure two-round Tari multi-signature scheme is as follows: A receiver sends their public
nonce; output commitment and range proof; and public spending key to the sender, but then decides to cancel the
transaction by refusing to provide a signature and sending an &quot;Abort&quot; message to the sender instead. The sender could,
if they wanted, forge the 2-of-2 signature using this rogue key attack and broadcast the transaction anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This attack is not applicable in the one-round, two-party scheme, since the receiver returns their information in an
all-or-nothing manner. However, the <em>receiver</em> could attempt to forge a signature, since they have the Sender's public
nonce, but there's nothing they can really do with this signature; they certainly cannot broadcast a transaction with it
because they don't have any of the transaction data at this stage.</p>
<p>We avoid rogue-key attacks in the Tari multi-recipient scheme by employing three rounds. In the first round, parties share a
hash of their public nonces, which each party can later use to verify that no nonces were changed after the actual
public nonces were shared.</p>

<p>This document describes the specification for Emoji Ids. Emoji Ids are encoded node ids used for humans to easily verify
peer node addresses.</p>

<p>Tari <a href="Glossary.html#communication-node">Communication Node</a>s are identified on the network via their <a href="Glossary.html#node-id">Node ID</a>; which in turn are derived from the node's
public key. Both the node id and public key are simple large integer numbers.</p>
<p>The most common practice for human beings to copy large numbers in cryptocurrency software is to scan a QR code or copy
and paste a value from one application to another. These numbers are typically encoded using hexadecimal or Base58
encoding. The user will then typically scan (parts) of the string by eye to ensure that the value was transferred
correctly.</p>
<p>For Tari, we propose encoding values, the node ID in particular, using emoji. The advantages of this approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emoji are more easily identifiable; and if selected carefully, less prone to identification errors (e.g. mistaking an
O for a 0).</li>
<li>The alphabet can be considerably larger than hexadecimal (16) or Base58 (58), resulting in shorter character sequences
in the encoding.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-specification"><a class="header" href="#the-specification">The specification</a></h3>
<h4 id="the-emoji-character-map"><a class="header" href="#the-emoji-character-map">The emoji character map</a></h4>
<p>An emoji alphabet of 1,024 characters is selected. Each emoji is assigned a unique index from 0 to 1023 inclusive. This
list is the emoji map. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>😀 =&gt; 0</li>
<li>😘 =&gt; 1</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>🦊 =&gt; 1023</li>
</ul>
<p>The emoji SHOULD be selected such that</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar looking emoji are excluded from the map. e.g. Neither 😁 or 😄 should be included. Similarly the Irish and
Côte d'Ivoirean flags look very similar, and both should be excluded.</li>
<li>Modified emoji (skin tones, gender modifiers) are excluded. Only the &quot;base&quot; emoji is considered.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="encoding"><a class="header" href="#encoding">Encoding</a></h4>
<p>The essential strategy in the encoding process is to map a sequence of 8-bit values onto a 10-bit alphabet. The general
encoding procedure is as follows:</p>
<p>Given a large integer value, represented as a <em>byte array</em>, <code>S</code>, in little-endian format (most significant digit last).
Assume the string is addressable, i.e. <code>S[i]</code> is the <code>i</code>th byte in the array.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set <code>CURSOR</code> to 0, Set <code>L</code> to a multiple of 10 that is <code>&lt;= len(S)</code>.</li>
<li>Set <code>IDX</code> to <code>[]</code> (an empty array)</li>
<li>While <code>CURSOR &lt; L</code>:
<ul>
<li>Set <code>L &lt;= S[CURSOR/8 + 1]</code>, the current low byte; if the index would overflow, set <code>L</code> to zero.</li>
<li>Set <code>H &lt;= S[CURSOR/8]</code>, the current high byte</li>
<li>Set <code>n &lt;= CURSOR % 8</code>, the position of the cursor in the current high byte</li>
<li>Set <code>i &lt;= ((H as u8) &lt;&lt; n) &lt;&lt; 2 + (L &gt;&gt; (6 - n))</code>, where the first shift left (<code>H as u8 &lt;&lt;n</code>) is on a one-byte width
(effectively losing the first n bits) and the second shift left is on a 8-byte width (u64).</li>
<li>Push <code>i</code> onto <code>IDX</code></li>
<li><code>CURSOR &lt;= CURSOR + 10</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Return <code>IDX</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The emoji string is created by mapping the <code>IDX</code> array to the emoji map.</p>
<h4 id="emoji-id-definition"><a class="header" href="#emoji-id-definition">Emoji ID definition</a></h4>
<p>The emoji ID is an emoji string of 12 characters. Each character encodes 10 bits according to the bitmap:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">+---------------------+------------------+-------------------+
|  Node Id (104 bits) | Version (6 bits) | Checksum (10 bits)|
+---------------------+------------------+-------------------+
</code></pre>
<p>The emoji ID is calculated from a 104-bit node id represented as 13 bytes (<code>B</code>) as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the current emoji ID version number, <code>v</code> and add <code>v &lt;&lt; 2</code> as an additional byte to <code>B</code>. This &quot;right-pads&quot; the
version in the last byte. This is necessary since we have a 14 byte (112 bit) sequence, which is not divisible by 10.
This padding sets the last 2 bits, which will be discarded, to zero.</li>
<li>Encode B into an emoji string with <code>L</code> = 11.</li>
<li>Calculate a 12th emoji using the Luhn mod 1024 checksum algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="decoding"><a class="header" href="#decoding">Decoding</a></h4>
<p>One can extract the node id from an emoji ID as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the checksum of the first 11 emoji using the Luhn mod 1024 algorithm. If it does not match the 12th emoji,
return with an error. if any emoji character is not in the emoji map, return an error.</li>
<li>Extract the version number:
<ol start="3">
<li>Do a reverse lookup of emoji<code>[10]</code> to find its index. Store this u64 value in <code>I</code>.</li>
<li>The Version number is <code>(I &amp;&amp; 0x3F) &gt;&gt; 2</code>. This can be used to set the Emoji map accordingly (and may have to be
done iteratively, since the version is encoded into the emoji string).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Set <code>CURSOR = 0</code>.</li>
<li>Set <code>B = []</code>, and empty byte array</li>
<li>While <code>CURSOR &lt;= 11</code>:
<ol start="4">
<li>Set <code>k &lt;= CURSOR * 2</code></li>
<li>Do a reverse lookup of the emoji<code>[CURSOR]</code> to find its index. Store this u64 value in <code>L</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>k &gt; 0</code>, set <code>H</code> to the reverse lookup index of emoji<code>[CURSOR-1]</code> as u8 (first 2 bits are discarded), else
<code>H=0</code>.</li>
<li>Set <code>v = ((H as u8)  &lt;&lt; (8-k)) + (L &gt;&gt; (2+k))</code>. Push v onto tho <code>B</code>.</li>
<li>Set <code>CURSOR &lt;= CURSOR + 1</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the algorithm completes, <code>B</code> holds the node ID.</p>
<h4 id="versioning"><a class="header" href="#versioning">Versioning</a></h4>
<p>The current emoji ID version number is 1. If the emoji alphabet changes, the version number MUST be incremented. This
will usually cause incompatible versions of the emoji ID to be detected. However, this is not fail-safe.</p>
<p>The last 6 bits of the 11th emoji encodes the version; this means that the first 4 bits are part of the node ID. On a
reverse mapping, there is a chance that the reverse mapping would offer a valid, but incorrect version number if the new
mapping are not chosen carefully.</p>
<h5 id="example"><a class="header" href="#example">Example.</a></h5>
<p>In version 1, 😘 =&gt; <code>0b0000_000001</code> = 1 in the map. Seeing 😘 as the 11th emoji in a string would result in a version
code of 1, which is consistent and expected.</p>
<p>However, in unlucky version 13, if 😘 moves in the map to number 13 (<code>0b0000_001101</code>), the version decoding would also
be valid and thus we wouldn't be able to unambiguously identify the version.</p>

<p>This Request for Comment (RFC) aims to describe Tari's ergonomic approach to securing funds in a hot wallet.
The focus is on mobile wallets, but the strategy described here is equally applicable to console or desktop wallets.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="description-9"><a class="header" href="#description-9">Description</a></h2>
<h3 id="rationale"><a class="header" href="#rationale">Rationale</a></h3>
<p>A major UX hurdle when users first interact with a crypto wallet is the friction they experience with the first user
experience.</p>
<p>A common theme: I want to play with some new wallet X that I saw advertised somewhere, so I download it and run it.
But first I get several screens that</p>
<ul>
<li>ask me to review my seed phrase,</li>
<li>ask me to write down my seed phrase,</li>
<li>prevent typical &quot;skip this&quot; tricks like taking a screenshot,</li>
<li>ask to confirm if I've written down my seed phrase,</li>
<li>force me to write a test, either by supplying a random sample of my seed phrase, or by getting me to type in the
whole thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>After all this, I play with the wallet a bit, and then typically, I uninstall it.</p>
<p>The goal of this RFC is to <strong>get the user playing with the wallet as quickly as possible</strong>. <em>Without</em> sacrificing
security whatsoever.</p>
<h3 id="a-staged-approach"><a class="header" href="#a-staged-approach">A staged approach</a></h3>
<p>This RFC proposes a smart, staged approach to wallet security. One that maximises user experience without compromising
safety.</p>
<p>Each step enforces more stringent security protocols on the user than the previous step.</p>
<p>The user moves from one step to another based on criteria that</p>
<ol>
<li>the user configures based on her preferences, or</li>
<li>uses sane predefined defaults.</li>
</ol>
<p>The criteria are generally based on the value of the wallet balance.</p>
<p>Once a user moves to a stage, the wallet does <em>not</em> move to a lower stage if the requirements for the stage are no longer
met.</p>
<p>Users may also jump to any more advanced stage from their wallet settings / configuration at any time.</p>
<h4 id="stage-zero---zero-balance"><a class="header" href="#stage-zero---zero-balance">Stage zero - zero balance</a></h4>
<p>When the user has a <em>zero balance</em>, there's no risk in letting them skip securing their wallet.</p>
<p>Therefore, Tari wallets SHOULD just skip the whole seed phrase ritual and let the user jump right into the action.</p>
<h4 id="stage-1a---a-reminder-to-write-down-your-seed-phrase"><a class="header" href="#stage-1a---a-reminder-to-write-down-your-seed-phrase">Stage 1a - a reminder to write down your seed phrase</a></h4>
<p>Once the user's balance exceeds the <code>MINIMUM_STAGE_ONE_BALANCE</code>, they will be prompted to review and write down their
seed phrase. The <code>MINIMUM_STAGE_ONE_BALANCE</code> is any non-zero balance by default.</p>
<p>After the transaction that causes the balance to exceed <code>MINIMUM_STAGE_ONE_BALANCE</code> is confirmed, the user is presented
with a friendly message: &quot;You now have <em>real</em> money in your wallet. If you accidentally delete your wallet app or lose
your device, your funds are lost, and there is no way to recover them unless you have safely kept a copy of your
<code>seed phrase</code> safe somewhere. Click 'Ok' to review and save the phrase now, or 'Do it later' to do it at a more
convenient time&quot;.</p>
<p>If the user elects <em>not</em> to save the phrase, the message pops up again periodically. Once per day, or when the balance
increases -- whichever is less frequent -- is sufficient without being too intrusive.</p>
<h4 id="stage-1b---simple-wallet-backups"><a class="header" href="#stage-1b---simple-wallet-backups">Stage 1b - simple wallet backups</a></h4>
<p>Users are used to storing their data in the cloud. Although this practice is frowned upon by crypto purists, for small
balances (the type you often keep in a hot wallet), using secure cloud storage for wallet backups is a fair
compromise between keeping the keys safe from attackers and protecting users from themselves.</p>
<p>The simple wallet backup saves the spending keys and values of the user's wallet to a personal cloud space (e.g. Google Drive,
Apple iCloud, Dropbox).</p>
<p>This solution does not require any additional input from the user besides providing authorisation to store in the cloud.
This can be done using the standard APIs and Authentication flows that each cloud provider publishes for their platform.</p>
<p>In particular, we do not ask for a password to encrypt the commitment data. The consequence is that anyone who gains
access to this data -- by stealing the user's cloud credentials -- <em>could</em> steal the user's funds.</p>
<p>Therefore, the threshold for moving from this stage to Stage 3, <code>STAGE_TWO_THRESHOLD_BALANCE</code> is relatively low;
somewhere in the region of $10 to $50.</p>
<p>The seed phrase MUST NOT be stored on the cloud in Stage 1b. Doing so would result in all <em>future</em> funds of the user being
lost if the backup were ever compromised. Since the backup is unencrypted in Stage 1b, we store the minimum amount of data
needed to recover the funds and limit the potential loss of funds in case of a breach to just that found in the commitments in the
backup, which should not be more than $50.</p>
<p>Backups MUST be authorised by the user when the first cloud backup is made and SHOULD be automatically updated after each
transaction is confirmed.</p>
<p>Restoring a wallet from Stage 1b entails <em>importing</em> the UTXO commitments into the user's current wallet.</p>
<p>Wallet authors MAY choose to exclude Stage 1b from the staged security protocol.</p>
<p>As usual, the user MUST be able to configure <code>STAGE_TWO_THRESHOLD_BALANCE</code> to suit their particular needs.</p>
<h4 id="stage-2---full-wallet-backups"><a class="header" href="#stage-2---full-wallet-backups">Stage 2 - full wallet backups</a></h4>
<p>Once a user has a significant balance (over <code>STAGE_TWO_THRESHOLD_BALANCE</code>), Stage 2 is active. Stage 2 entails a full,
encrypted backup of the user's wallet to the cloud. The user needs to provide a <strong>password</strong> to perform and secure the encryption.</p>
<p>This makes the user's fund safer while at rest in the cloud. It also introduces an additional point of failure: the user
can forget their wallet's encryption password.</p>
<p>Stage 1b and 2 are similar in functionality but different in scope (Stage 2 allows us to store all the wallet
metadata, rather than just the commitments). For this reason, Stage 1b is optional.</p>
<p>Backups MUST be authorised by the user when the first cloud backup is made and SHOULD be automatically updated after each
transaction.</p>
<p>When migrating from Stage 1 to Stage 2, the Stage 1b backups SHOULD be deleted.</p>
<h4 id="stage-3---sweep-to-cold-wallet"><a class="header" href="#stage-3---sweep-to-cold-wallet">Stage 3 - Sweep to cold wallet</a></h4>
<p>Above a given limit -- user-defined, or the default <code>MAX_HOT_WALLET_BALANCE</code>, the user should be prompted to transfer
funds into a cold wallet. The amount to sweep can be calculated as <code>MAX_HOT_WALLET_BALANCE</code> - <code>SAFE_HOT_WALLET_BALANCE</code>.</p>
<p>If the user ignores the prompt, they SHOULD be reminded one week later. From the second prompt onward, users SHOULD be given
an option to re-configure the values for <code>MAX_HOT_WALLET_BALANCE</code> and <code>SAFE_HOT_WALLET_BALANCE</code>.</p>
<p>Assuming one-sided payments are live, the user SHOULD be able to configure a <code>COLD_WALLET_ADDRESS</code> in the wallet.</p>
<p>For security reasons, a user SHOULD be asked for their 2FA confirmation, if it is configured, before broadcasting the
sweep transaction to the blockchain.</p>
<h4 id="security-hygiene"><a class="header" href="#security-hygiene">Security hygiene</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>From stage 1 onwards Users should be asked periodically whether they still have their seed phrase written down.
Once every two months is sufficient.</li>

<p>By reviewing the <a href="RFC-0160_BlockSerialization.html#tari-block-and-mining-template-data-types">block and mining template fields</a> below, we have the following underlying data types for serialization:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>bool</code></li>
<li><code>u8</code></li>
<li><code>u16</code></li>
<li><code>u32</code></li>
<li><code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code></li>
</ol>
<p>For 1. to 4. and all numbers, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints">Base 128 Varint</a> encoding MUST be used.</p>
<p>From the Protocol Buffers documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Varints are a method of serializing integers using one or more bytes. Smaller numbers take a smaller number of bytes. Each byte in a varint, except the last byte, has the most significant bit (msb) set – this indicates that there are further bytes to come. The lower 7 bits of each byte are used to store the two's complement representation of the number in groups of 7 bits, least significant group first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For 5., the dynamically sized <code>Vec</code> array type, the encoded array MUST be preceded by a number indicating the length of the array. This length MUST also be encoded as a varint. By prepending the length of the array, the decoder knows how many elements to decode as part of the sequence.</p>
<h2 id="block-field-ordering"><a class="header" href="#block-field-ordering">Block field ordering</a></h2>

</ul>
<h3 id="abstract-1"><a class="header" href="#abstract-1">Abstract</a></h3>
<p>The backbone of the Tari communication network consists of a large number of nodes that maintain peer connections between each other.
These nodes forward and propagate encrypted and unencrypted data messages through the network such as joining requests, discovery requests, <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a>s and completed <a href="Glossary.html#block">block</a>s.
Network clients, not responsible for maintaining the network, are able to create ad hoc connections with nodes on the network to perform joining and discovery requests.
The majority of communication between clients and nodes will be performed using direct Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication once the discovery process was used to obtain the online communication addresses of peers.
Where possible the efficient Kademlia based directed forwarding of encrypted data messages can be used to perform quick node discovery and joining of clients and nodes on the Tari communication network. 
Where messages are of importance to a wide variety of entities on the network, Gossip protocol based message propagation can be performed to distribute the message to the entire network.</p>
<h3 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>The Tari communication network is a variant of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a> network that allows for fast discovery of nodes, with an added ability to perform Gossip protocol based broadcasting of data messages to the entire network.
The majority of the communication required on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">Base Layer</a> and <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset-network">Digital Asset Network</a> (DAN) will be performed via direct P2P communication between known clients and nodes.
Alternatively, the Tari communication network can be used for broadcasting joining requests, discovery requests and propagating data messages such as completed blocks, transactions and data messages that are of interest to a large part of the Tari communication network. </p>
<p>The Tari communication network consists of a number of different entities that need to communicate in a distributed and ad-hoc manner. 
The primary entities that need to communicate are Validator Nodes (VN), <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">Base Node</a>s (BN), <a href="Glossary.html#wallet">Wallet</a>s (W) and <a href="Glossary.html#token-wallet">Token Wallet</a>s (TW).
Here are some examples of different communication tasks that need to be performed by these entities on the Tari Communication network:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Nodes on the Base Layer need to propagate completed blocks and transactions to other Base Nodes using Gossip protocol based broadcasting.</li>
<li>Validator Nodes need to efficiently discover other Validator Nodes in the process of forming Validator Node committees. </li>
<li>Wallets need to communicate and negotiate with other Wallets to create transactions. They also need the ability to submit transactions to the <a href="Glossary.html#mempool">mempool</a> of Base Nodes.</li>
<li>Token Wallets need to communicate with Validator Node <a href="Glossary.html#committee">committee</a>s and other Token Wallets to construct and send DAN instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an overview communication matrix that show which source entities SHOULD initiate communication with destination entities on the Tari Communication network:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>        \Destination<br>Source</th><th>Validator Node</th><th>Base Node</th><th>Wallet</th><th>Token Wallet</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Validator Node</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Base Node</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wallet</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>Token Wallet</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h4 id="communication-nodes-and-communication-clients"><a class="header" href="#communication-nodes-and-communication-clients">Communication Nodes and Communication Clients</a></h4>
<p>To simplify the description of the Tari communication network, the different entities with similar behaviour were grouped into two groups: Communication Nodes and Communication Clients.
Validator Nodes and Base Nodes are Communication Nodes (CN).
Wallets and Token Wallets are Communication Clients (CC).
CNs form the core communication infrastructure of the Tari communication network and are responsible for maintaining the Tari communication network by receiving, forwarding and distributing joining requests, discovery requests, data messages and routing information.
CCs are different from CNs in that they do not maintain the network and they are not responsible for propagating any joining requests, discovery requests, data messages and routing information.
They do make use of the network to submit their own joining requests and perform discovery request of other specific CNs and CCs when they need to communicate with them.
Once a CC has discovered the CC or CN they want to communicate with, they will establish a direct P2P channel with them.
The Tari communication network is unaware of this direct P2P communication once discovery is completed.</p>
<p>The different entity types MUST be grouped into the different communication node types as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Entity Type</th><th>Communication Node Type</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Validator Node</td><td>Communication Node</td></tr>
<tr><td>Base Node</td><td>Communication Node</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wallet</td><td>Communication Client</td></tr>
<tr><td>Token Wallet</td><td>Communication Client</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h4 id="unique-identification-of-communication-nodes-and-communication-clients"><a class="header" href="#unique-identification-of-communication-nodes-and-communication-clients">Unique identification of Communication Nodes and Communication Clients</a></h4>
<p>In the Tari communication network, each CN or CC makes use of a node ID to determine their position in the network.
This node ID is either assigned based on registration on the Base Layer or can be derived from the CNs or CCs identification public key.
The method used to obtain a node ID will either enhance or limit the trustworthiness of that entity when propagating messages through them on the Tari communication network.
When performing the broadcasting of data messages or propagating discovery requests, nodes with registration assigned node IDs are considered more trustworthy compared to nodes with derived node IDs. </p>
<p>Obtaining a node ID from registration on the Base Layer is important as it will limit the potential of some parties performing <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/263.pdf">Eclipse attacks</a> on the network.
Registration makes it more difficult for <a href="Glossary.html#bad-actor">Bad Actor</a>s to position themselves in ideal patterns on the network to perform disruptive operations and actions. 
In sensitive situations or situations where the Kademlia-style directed propagation of messages are vulnerable, gossip protocol-based broadcasting of messages can be performed as a less efficient, but safer alternative to ensure that the message will successfully reach the rest of the network.</p>
<p>The similarity or distance between different node IDs can be calculated by performing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">Hamming distance</a> between the bits of the two node ID numbers.
The Hamming distance can be implemented as an Exclusive OR (XOR) between the bits of the numbers and the summation of the resulting true bits.
CCs and/or CNs that have similar node IDs, that produce a small Hamming distance, are located in similar regions of the Tari communication network.
This does not mean that their geographic locations are near each other, but rather that their location in the network is similar.
A thresholding scheme can be applied to the Hamming distance to ensure that only neighboring CNs with similar node IDs are allowed to share and propagate specific information.
As an example, only routing table information that contains similar node IDs to the requesting CCs or CNs node ID should be shared with them.
Limiting the sharing of routing table information makes it more difficult to map the entire Tari communication network.</p>
<p>The recommended method of node ID assignment for each Tari communication network entity type MUST be implemented as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Entity Type</th><th>Communication Node Type</th><th>Node ID Assignment</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Validator Node</td><td>Communication Node</td><td>Registration</td></tr>
<tr><td>Base Node</td><td>Communication Node</td><td>Derived</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wallet</td><td>Communication Client</td><td>Derived</td></tr>
<tr><td>Token Wallet</td><td>Communication Client</td><td>Derived</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Note that <a href="Glossary.html#mining-server">Mining Server</a>s and <a href="Glossary.html#mining-worker">Mining Worker</a>s are excluded from the Tari communication network.
A Mining Worker will have a local or remote P2P connection with a Mining Server.
A Mining Server will have a local or remote P2P connection with a Base Node.
They do not need to make use of the communication network and they are not responsible for propagating any messages on the network.
The parent Base Node will perform any communication tasks on the Tari communication network on their behalf.</p>
<h4 id="online-communication-address-peer-address-and-routing-table"><a class="header" href="#online-communication-address-peer-address-and-routing-table">Online Communication Address, Peer Address and Routing Table</a></h4>
<p>Each CC and CN on the Tari communication network will have identification cryptographic keys, a node ID and an online communication address.
The online communication address SHOULD be either an IPv4, IPv6, URL, Tor (Base32) or I2P (Base32) address and can be stored using the network address type as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Description</th><th align="left">Data type</th><th align="left">Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">address type</td><td align="left">uint4</td><td align="left">Specify if IPv4/IPv6/Url/Tor/I2P</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">address</td><td align="left">char array</td><td align="left">IPv4, IPv6, URL, Tor (Base32), I2P (Base32) address</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">port</td><td align="left">uint16</td><td align="left">port number</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The address type is used to determine how to interpret the address characters. An I2P address can be interpreted as &quot;{52
address characters}.b32.i2p&quot;. The Tor address should be interpreted as &quot;http://{16_or_52_address_chars}.onion/&quot;. The
IPv4 and IPv6 address can be stored in the address field without modification. URL addresses can be used for nodes with
dynamic IP addresses.</p>
<p>A Tor or I2P address can be used when anonymity is important for a CC or CN.
The IPv4, IPv6 and URL address types do not provide any privacy features but do provide increased bandwidth. </p>
<p>Each CC or CN has a local routing table that contains the online communication addresses of all CCs and CNs on the Tari communication network known to that CC or CN.
When a CC or CN wants to join the Tari communication network, the online communication address of at least one other CN that is part of the network needs to be known.
The online communication address of the initial CN can either be manually provided or a bootstrapped list of &quot;reliable&quot; and persistent CNs can be provided with the Validator Node, Base Node, Wallet or Token Wallet software.
The new CC or CN can then request additional peer contact information of other CNs from the initial peers to extend their own routing table.</p>
<p>The routing table consists of a list of peer addresses that link node IDs, public identification keys and online communication addresses of each known CC and CN.</p>
<p>The Peer Address stored in the routing table MAY be implemented as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Description</th><th align="left">Data type</th><th align="left">Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody>

</tbody></table>
<p>When a new CC or CN wants to join the Tari communication network they need to submit a joining request to the rest of the network.
The joining request contains the peer address of the new CC or CN.
Each CN that receives the joining request can decide if they want to add the new CCs or CNs contact information to their local routing table.
When a CN, that received the joining request, has a similar node ID to the new CC or CN then that node must add the peer address to their routing table.
All CNs with similar node IDs to the new CC or CN should have a copy of the new peer address in their routing tables.</p>
<p>To limit potential attacks, only one registration for a specific node type with the same online communication address can be stored in the routing table of a CN.
This restriction will limit Bad Actors from spinning up multiple CNs on a single computer.</p>
<h4 id="joining-the-network-using-a-joining-request"><a class="header" href="#joining-the-network-using-a-joining-request">Joining the Network using a Joining Request</a></h4>
<p>A new CC or CN needs to register their peer address on the Tari communication network.
This is achieved by submitting a network joining request to a subset of CNs selected from the routing table of the new CC or CN.
These peers will forward the joining request, with the peer address, to the rest of the network until CNs with similar node IDs have been reached.
CNs with similar node IDs will then add the new peer address of the new node to their routing table, allowing for fast discovery of the new CC or CN. </p>
<p>Other CCs and CNs will then be able to retrieve the new CCs or CNs peer address by submitting discovery requests.
Once the peer address of the desired CC or CN has been discovered then a direct P2P communication channel can be established between the two parties for any future communication.
After discovery, the rest of the Tari communication network will be unaware of any further communication between the two parties.</p>
<h4 id="sending-data-messages-and-discovery-requests"><a class="header" href="#sending-data-messages-and-discovery-requests">Sending Data Messages and Discovery Requests</a></h4>
<p>The majority of all communication on the Tari communication network will be performed using direct P2P channels established between different CCs and CNs once they are aware of the peer addresses of each other that contain their online communication addresses.
Message propagation on the network will typically consist only of joining and discovery requests where a CC or CN wants to join the network or retrieve the peer address of another CC or CN so that a direct P2P channel can be established.</p>
<p>Messages can be transmitted in this network in either an unencrypted or encrypted form.
Typically messages that have been sent in unencrypted form are of interest to a number of CNs on the network and should be propagated so that every CN that is interested in that data message obtains a copy.
Block and Transaction propagation are examples of data messages where multiple entities on the Tari communication network are interested in that data message; this requires propagation through the entire Tari communication network in unencrypted form.</p>
<p>Encrypted data messages make use of the source and destinations identification cryptographic keys to construct a shared secret with which the message can be encoded and decoded.
This ensures that only the two parties are able to decode the data message as it is propagated through the communication network.
This mechanism can be used to perform private discovery requests, where the online communication address of the source node is encrypted and propagated through the network until it reached the destination node.
Private discovery requests can only be performed if both parties are online at the same time.
Encryption of the data message ensures that only the destination node is able to view the online address of the source node as the data message moves through the network.
Once the destination node receives and decrypts the data message, that node is then able to establish a P2P communication channel with the source node for any further communication.</p>
<p>Propagation of completely private discovery request, hidden as an encrypted data message, can be performed as a broadcast through the entire network using the Gossip protocol.
Propagation of public discovery requests can be performed using more efficient directed propagation using the Kademlia protocol.
As encrypted message with visible destinations tend to not be of interest to the rest of the network, directed propagation using the Kademlia protocol to forward these messages to the correct parties are preferred.
Privacy of a CCs online address, whom is sending a transaction to a Base Node, may be enhanced if the transaction is encrypted and sent to a Base Node with a node ID that is not the closest to the CCs node ID. This should prevent linking a transaction to the originating online address.</p>
<p>This same encryption technique can be used to send encrypted messages to a single node or a group of nodes, where the group of nodes have shared identification keys.
A Validation Committee is an example of a group of CNs that have shared identification keys for the committee.
The shared identification keys ensure that all members of that committee are able to receive and decrypt data messages that were sent to the committee.</p>
<h4 id="maintaining-connections-with-peers"><a class="header" href="#maintaining-connections-with-peers">Maintaining connections with peers</a></h4>
<p>CCs and CNs establish and maintain connections with peers differently.
CCs only create a few short-lived ad hoc channels and CNs create and maintain long-lived channels with a number of peers.</p>
<p>If a CC is unaware of a destination CNs or CCs online communication address then the address first needs to be obtained using a discovery request.
When a CC already knows the communication address of the CC or CN that he wants to communicate with, then a direct P2P channel can be established between the two peers for the duration of the communication task.
The communication channel can then be closed as soon as the communication task has been completed.</p>
<p>CNs consisting of VNs and BNs typically attempt to maintain communication channels with a large number of peers.
The distribution of peers (VNs vs BNs) that a single CN keeps communication channels open with can change depending on the type of node.
A CN that is also a BN should maintain more peer connections with other BNs, but should also have some connections with other VNs.</p>
<p>Having some connections with VNs are important as BNs have derived node IDs and not registered node IDs such as VNs, making it possible for the CN to be separated from the main network and become victim to an <a href="https://www.radixdlt.com/post/what-is-an-eclipse-attack">Eclipse attack</a>.
Having some connections with VNs will make it more difficult to separate the CN from the network and will ensure successful propagation of transactions and completed blocks from that CN. </p>
<p>A CN that is also a VN should maintain more peer connections with other VNs, but also have some connections with BNs.
CNs that are part of Validator Node committees should attempt to maintain permanent connections with the other members of the committee to ensure that quick consensus can be achieved.</p>
<p>To maintain connections with peers, the following process can be performed.
Discover peers using discovery requests, and add their details to the local routing table.
The CN can decide how the peer connections should be selected from the routing table by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>manually selecting a subset,</li>
<li>automatically selecting a random subset or</li>
<li>selecting a subset of neighbouring nodes with similar node IDs. </li>
</ul>
<p>Maintaining communication channels is important and the following process can be followed in an attempt to keep peer connections alive:
For an existing peer connection.
When more than 30 minutes have passed since the last communication with that peer, then a heartbeat message should be sent to the peer in an attempt to keep the connection with the peer alive.
If the peer connection was not established for a specific purpose, such as with the connections between committee members, then a new replacement peer can be selected from the local routing table.
A new connection can then be established and maintained between the current node and the newly selected node.
If that specific connection is important, such as with the connections between committee members, then the current CN or CC must wait and attempt to create a new connection with that same peer.
If more than 90 minutes have passed since the last successful communication with the peer node, a new discovery request can be sent on the Tari communication network in an attempt to locate that peer again.
Losing of a peer might happen in cases where the CN or CC went temporarily offline and their dynamic communication address changed, requiring the discovery process to be performed again before a direct P2P communication channel can be established.</p>

<h2 id="goals-15"><a class="header" href="#goals-15">Goals</a></h2>
<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe the message serialization formats for message payloads used in the Tari network.</p>
<h2 id="related-requests-for-comment-13"><a class="header" href="#related-requests-for-comment-13">Related Requests for Comment</a></h2>
<p><a href="RFC-0170_NetworkCommunicationProtocol.html">RFC-0710: Tari Communication Network and Network Communication Protocol</a></p>
<h2 id="description-11"><a class="header" href="#description-11">Description</a></h2>
<p>One way of interpreting the Tari network is that it is a large peer-to-peer messaging application. The entities chatting
on the network include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Wallets</li>
<li>Base nodes</li>
<li>Validator nodes</li>
</ul>
<p>The types of messages that these entities send might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text messages</li>
<li>Transaction messages</li>
<li>Block propagation messages</li>
<li>Asset creation instructions</li>
<li>Asset state change instructions</li>
<li>State Checkpoint messages</li>
</ul>
<p>For successful communication to occur, the following needs to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The message is translated from its memory storage format into a standard payload format that will be transported over
the wire.</li>
<li>The communication module wraps the payload into a message format, which may entail any/all of
<ul>
<li>adding a message header to describe the type of payload;</li>
<li>encrypting the message;</li>
<li>signing the message;</li>
<li>adding destination/recipient metadata.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The communication module then sends the message over the wire.</li>
<li>The recipient receives the message and unwraps it, possibly performing any/all of the following:
<ul>
<li>decryption;</li>
<li>verifying signatures;</li>
<li>extracting the payload;</li>
<li>passing the serialized payload to modules that are interesting in that particular message type.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The message is deserialized into the correct data structure for use by the receiving software</li>
</ul>
<p>This document only covers the first and last steps, i.e. serializing data from in-memory objects to a format that can
be transmitted over the wire. The other steps are handled by the Tari communication protocol.</p>
<p>In addition to machine-to-machine communication, we also standardize on human-to-machine communication. Use cases for
this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handcrafting instructions or transactions. The ideal format here is a very human-readable format.</li>
<li>Copying transactions or instructions from cold wallets. The ideal format here is a compact but easy-to-copy format.</li>
<li>Peer-to-peer text messaging. This is just a special case of what has already been described, with the message
structure containing a unicode <code>message_text</code> field.</li>
</ul>
<p>When sending a message from a human to the network, the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>The message is deserialized into the native structure.</li>
<li>The deserialization acts as an automatic validation step.</li>
<li>Additional validation can be performed.</li>
<li>The usual machine-to-machine process is followed, as described above.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="binary-serialization-formats"><a class="header" href="#binary-serialization-formats">Binary Serialization Formats</a></h3>
<p>The ideal properties for binary serialization formats are:</p>
<ul>
<li>widely used across multiple platforms and languages, but with excellent Rust support;</li>
<li>compact binary representation; and</li>
<li>serialization &quot;Just Works&quot;(TM) with little or no additional coding overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several candidates fulfill these properties to some degree.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pros:
<ul>
<li>Very mature (was developed in the 1980s)</li>
<li>Large number of implementations</li>
<li>Dovetails nicely into ZMQ </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons:
<ul>
<li>Limited Rust/Serde support</li>
<li>Requires schema (additional coding overhead if no automated tools for this exist)</li>

<ul>
<li>Very compact</li>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Multiple language support</li>
<li>Good Rust/Serde support</li>

<p>Similar to Message Pack, but also requires schemas to be written and compiled. Serialization 
performance and size
are similar to Message Pack. It Can work with ZMQ, but is better designed to be used with gRPC.</p>

<p>Similar to Protobuf, but claims to be much faster. Rust is supported.</p>
<h4 id="hand-rolled-serialization"><a class="header" href="#hand-rolled-serialization">Hand-rolled Serialization</a></h4>
<p><a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/py:chapter7#Serialization-Libraries">Hintjens recommends</a> using hand-rolled serialization for
bulk messaging. While Pieter usually offers sage advice, I'm going to argue against using custom serializers at this
stage for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're unlikely to improve hugely over MessagePack.</li>
<li>Since Serde does 95% of our work for us with MessagePack, there's a significant development overhead (and new bugs)
involved with a hand-rolled solution.</li>
<li>We'd have to write de/serializers for every language that wants Tari bindings; whereas every major language has a
MessagePack implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="serialization-in-tari"><a class="header" href="#serialization-in-tari">Serialization in Tari</a></h3>
<p>Deciding between these protocols is largely a matter of preference, since there isn't that much difference between them.
Given that ZMQ is used in other places in the Tari network, MessagePack looks to be a good fit while offering a compact
data structure and highly performant de/serialization. In Rust, in particular, there's first-class support for MessagePack
in Serde.</p>
<p>For human-readable formats, it makes little sense to deviate from JSON. For copy-paste semantics, the extra compression
that Base64 offers over raw hex or Base58 makes it attractive.</p>
<p>Many Tari data types' binary representation will be the straightforward MessagePack version of each field in the related
<code>struct</code>. In these cases, a straightforward <code>#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]</code> is all that is required to enable the data
structure to be sent over the wire.</p>
<p>However, other structures might need fine-tuning, or hand-written serialization procedures. To capture both use cases,
it is proposed that a <code>MessageFormat</code> trait be defined:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust compile_fail">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>pub trait MessageFormat: Sized {
    fn to_binary(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;, MessageFormatError&gt;;
    fn to_json(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;String, MessageFormatError&gt;;
    fn to_base64(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;String, MessageFormatError&gt;;

    fn from_binary(msg: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, MessageFormatError&gt;;
    fn from_json(msg: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, MessageFormatError&gt;;
    fn from_base64(msg: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, MessageFormatError&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This trait will have default implementations to cover most use cases (e.g. a simple call through to <code>serde_json</code>). Serde
also offers significant ability to tweak how a given struct will be serialized through the use of
<a href="https://serde.rs/attributes.html">attributes</a>.</p>

<h3 id="broad-requirements-1"><a class="header" href="#broad-requirements-1">Broad Requirements</a></h3>
<p>Tari network peer communication must facilitate secure, private and efficient communication
between peers. Broadly, a <a href="Glossary.html#communication-node">communication node</a> or <a href="Glossary.html#communication-client">communication client</a> MUST be capable of:</p>
<ul>
<li>bidirectional communication between multiple connected peers;</li>
<li>private and secure over-the-wire communication;</li>
<li>understanding and constructing Tari messages;</li>
<li>encrypting and decrypting message payloads;</li>
<li>gracefully reestablishing dropped connections; and (optionally)</li>
<li>communicating to a SOCKS5 proxy (for connections over Tor and I2P).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, communication nodes MUST be capable of performing the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>opening a control port for establishing secure peer channels;</li>
<li>maintaining a list of known peers in the form of a routing table;</li>
<li>forwarding directed messages to neighbouring peers; and</li>
<li>broadcasting messages to neighbouring peers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overall-architectural-design"><a class="header" href="#overall-architectural-design">Overall Architectural Design</a></h3>
<p>The Tari communication layer has a modular design to allow for the various communicating nodes and clients to
use the same infrastructure code.</p>
<p>The design is influenced by an open-source library called <a href="http://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a> and the ZeroMQ C bindings are a dependency of
the project. ZeroMQ's over-the-wire protocol is relatively simple, and replicating ZeroMQ framing in a custom
implementation should not be prohibitively difficult. However, ZeroMQ offers many valuable features, which would be a 
significantly larger undertaking to reproduce. Fortunately, bindings or native ports are available in numerous languages.</p>
<p>To learn more about ZeroMQ, read <a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all">the guide</a>. It's an enjoyable and worthwhile read.</p>
<p>A quick overview of what ZeroMQ provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple socket Application Programming Interface (API).</li>
<li>Some well-defined patterns to connect sockets together.</li>
<li>Sockets that are tiny asynchronous message queues, which:
<ul>
<li>abstract away complexity around the underlying socket;</li>
<li>are transport agnostic, meaning you can choose between Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Pragmatic General 
Multicast (PGM), Inter-process Communication (IPC) and in-process (inproc) transports with little or no changes to code; 
and</li>
<li>transparently reconnect when connections are dropped.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>inproc</code> transport for message passing between threads without mutex locks.</li>
<li>Built-in protocol for asymmetric encryption over the wire using Curve25519.</li>
<li>Ability to send and receive multipart messages using a simple framing scheme. More info <a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/php:chapter2#toc11">here</a>.</li>
<li>Support for Secure Socket (SOCKS) proxies.</li>
</ul>
<p>This document will refer to several <a href="http://api.zeromq.org/2-1:zmq-socket">ZeroMQ socket</a>s. These are referred to by prepending <code>ZMQ_</code> and the name
of the socket in capitals. For example, <code>ZMQ_ROUTER</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note about ZeroMQ frames and multipart messages:</strong></p>
<p>ZeroMQ frames are length-specified blocks of binary data and can be strung together to make multipart messages.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">|5|H|E|L|L|O|*|0|*|3|F|O|O|+|
* = more flag
+ = no more flag
</code></pre>
<p><em>A multipart message consisting of three frames &quot;HELLO&quot;, a zero-length frame and &quot;FOO&quot;</em></p>
<p>When this RFC mentions 'multipart messages', this is what it's referring to.</p>
<h4 id="establishing-a-connection"><a class="header" href="#establishing-a-connection">Establishing a Connection</a></h4>
<p>Every participating <a href="Glossary.html#communication-node">communication node</a> SHOULD open a control socket (refer to <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#controlservice">ControlService</a>) to allow peers to negotiate and
establish a peer connection. The <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#netaddress">NetAddress</a> of the control socket is what is stored in peers' routing tables and will
be used to establish new ephemeral <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#peerconnection">PeerConnection</a>s. Any peer that wants to connect MUST establish a connection
to the control socket of the destination peer to negotiate a new encrypted PeerConnection.</p>
<p>Once a connection is established, messages can be sent and received directly to or from the <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#peer">Peer</a>.</p>
<p>Incoming messages are validated, deserialized and handled as appropriate.</p>
<h4 id="encryption"><a class="header" href="#encryption">Encryption</a></h4>
<p>Two forms of encryption are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over-the-wire encryption, in which traffic between nodes is encrypted using ZMQ's <a href="http://curvezmq.org/page:read-the-docs">CURVE</a>
implementation.</li>
<li>Payload encryption, in which the <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#messageenvelopebody">MessageEnvelopeBody</a> is encrypted in such a way that it can only be decrypted by the 
destination recipient.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="messageenvelope-wire-format"><a class="header" href="#messageenvelope-wire-format">MessageEnvelope Wire format</a></h4>
<p>Every Tari message MUST use the MessageEnvelope format. This format consists of four frames of a multipart message.</p>
<p>A MessageEnvelope  represents a message that has either just come off or is about to go on to the wire. and consists of 
the following:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Frame</th><th>Length (Octets)</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>identity</td><td>0</td><td>8</td><td><code>[u8;8]</code></td><td>The identifier that a <code>ZMQ_ROUTER</code> socket expects so that it knows the intended destination of the message. This can be thought of as a session token.</td></tr>
<tr><td>version</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td><code>u8</code></td><td>The wire protocol version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>header</td><td>2</td><td>Varies</td><td><code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code></td><td>Serialized bytes of data containing an unencrypted <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#messageenvelopeheader">MessageEnvelopeHeader</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>body</td><td>3</td><td>Varies</td><td><code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code></td><td>Serialized bytes of data containing an unencrypted or encrypted <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#messageenvelopebody">MessageEnvelopeBody</a>.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The header and decrypted body MUST be deserializable as per <a href="RFC-0171_MessageSerialisation.html">RFC-0171: MessageSerialization</a>.</p>
<h4 id="messageenvelopeheader"><a class="header" href="#messageenvelopeheader">MessageEnvelopeHeader</a></h4>
<p>Every MessageEnvelope MUST have an unencrypted header containing the following fields:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>version</td><td><code>u8</code></td><td>Message protocol version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>source</td><td><code>PublicKey</code></td><td>Source public key.</td></tr>
<tr><td>dest</td><td><code>Option&lt;NodeDestination&gt;</code></td><td>Destination <a href="Glossary.html#node-id">node ID</a> or public key. A destination is optional.</td></tr>
<tr><td>signature</td><td><code>[u8]</code></td><td>Signature of the message header and body, signed with the private key of the source.</td></tr>
<tr><td>flags</td><td><code>u8</code></td><td><ul><li>bit 0: 1 indicates that the message body is encrypted</li><li>bits 1-7: reserved</li></ul>.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>A <a href="Glossary.html#communication-node">communication node</a> and <a href="Glossary.html#communication-client">communication client</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST validate the signature of the message using the source's public key.</li>
<li>MUST reject the message if the signature verification fails.</li>
<li>If the encryption bit flag is set:
<ul>
<li>MUST attempt to decrypt the <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#messageenvelopebody">MessageEnvelopeBody</a>; or failing that</li>
<li>MUST forward the message to a subset of peers using the <code>Closest</code> <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#outboundmessageservice">BroadcastStrategy</a>.</li>
<li>MUST discard the message if the body is not encrypted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="messageenvelopebody"><a class="header" href="#messageenvelopebody">MessageEnvelopeBody</a></h4>
<p>A MessageEnvelopeBody is the payload of the [MessageEnvelope]. A <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#messageenvelopebody">MessageEnvelopeBody</a> may be encrypted as required.</p>
<p>It consists of a <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#messageheader">MessageHeader</a> and <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#message">Message</a> of a particular predefined <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#messagetype">MessageType</a>.</p>
<h4 id="messagetype"><a class="header" href="#messagetype">MessageType</a></h4>
<p>An enumeration of the messages that are part of the Tari network. MessageTypes are represented
as an unsigned eight-bit integer and each value must be mapped to a corresponding Message struct.</p>
<p>All MessageTypes fall within a particular numerical range according to the message's concern:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Range</th><th># Message Types</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>reserved</code></td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>Reserved for control messages such as <code>Ack</code>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>net</code></td><td>1-32</td><td>32</td><td>Network-related messages such as <code>join</code> and <code>discover</code>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>peer</code></td><td>33-64</td><td>32</td><td>Peer connection messages, such as <code>establish connection</code>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>blockchain</code></td><td>65-96</td><td>32</td><td>Messages related to the blockchain, such as <code>add block</code>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>vn</code></td><td>97-224</td><td>128</td><td>Messages related to the validator nodes, such as <code>execute instruction</code>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>extended</code></td><td>225-255</td><td>30</td><td>Reserved for future use.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In documentation, MessageTypes can be referred to by the category and name. For example, <code>peer::EstablishConnection</code> and
<code>net::Discover</code>.</p>
<h4 id="messageheader"><a class="header" href="#messageheader">MessageHeader</a></h4>
<p>Every Tari message MUST have a header containing the following fields:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>version</td><td><code>u8</code></td><td>The message version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>message_type</td><td><code>u8</code></td><td>An enumeration of the message type of the body. Refer to <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#messagetype">MessageType</a>.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>As this is part of the <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#messageenvelopebody">MessageEnvelopeBody</a>, it can be encrypted along with the rest of the message,
which keeps the type of message private.</p>
<h4 id="messagebody"><a class="header" href="#messagebody">MessageBody</a></h4>
<p>Messages are an intention to perform a task. MessageType names should thus be a verb such as <code>net::Join</code> or <code>blockchain::AddBlock</code>.</p>
<p>All messages can be categorized as follows; each categorization has rules for how they should be handled:</p>
<ul>
<li>A propagation message
<ul>
<li>SHOULD NOT have a destination in the MessageHeader;</li>
<li>MUST be forwarded;</li>
<li>SHOULD use the <code>Random</code> BroadcastStrategy;</li>
<li>SHOULD discard a message that it has seen within the <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#duplicatemessagewindow">DuplicateMessageWindow</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A direct message
<ul>
<li>MUST have a destination in the MessageHeader;</li>
<li>SHOULD be discarded if it does not have a destination;</li>
<li>SHOULD discard a message that it has seen before;</li>
<li>MUST use the <code>Direct</code> BroadcastStrategy if a destination peer is known;</li>
<li>SHOULD use the <code>Closest</code> BroadcastStrategy if a destination peer is not known.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An encrypted message
<ul>
<li>MUST undergo an attempt to be decrypted by all recipients;</li>
<li>MUST be forwarded by recipients if it cannot be decrypted;</li>
<li>SHOULD discard a message that it has seen before.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#messagetype">MessageType</a> in the header MUST be used to determine the type of the message deserialized.
If the deserialization fails, the message SHOULD be discarded.</p>
<h4 id="duplicatemessagewindow"><a class="header" href="#duplicatemessagewindow">DuplicateMessageWindow</a></h4>
<p>A configurable length of time for which message signatures should be tracked in order to eliminate duplicate messages.
This should be long enough to make it highly unlikely that a particular message will be processed again
and short enough to not be a burden on the node.</p>
<h4 id="inboundconnection"><a class="header" href="#inboundconnection">InboundConnection</a></h4>
<p>A thin wrapper around a <code>ZMQ_ROUTER</code> socket, which binds to a <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#netaddress">NetAddress</a> and accepts incoming multipart messages.
This connection blocks until there is data to read, or a timeout is reached. In both cases, the <code>receive</code> method
can be called again (i.e. in a loop) to continue listening for messages. Client code should run this loop in its own thread.
<code>send</code> is only called (if at all) in response to an incoming message.</p>
<p>Fields may include</p>
<ul>
<li>a NetAddress;</li>
<li>a timeout;</li>
<li>underlying <a href="http://api.zeromq.org/2-1:zmq-socket">ZeroMQ socket</a>.</li>

<p>Methods may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>receive()</code></li>
<li><code>send(data)</code></li>
<li><code>set_encryption(secret_key)</code></li>
<li><code>set_socks_proxy(address)</code></li>
<li><code>set_hwm(v)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>An InboundConnection:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST perform the &quot;server-side&quot; <a href="http://curvezmq.org/page:read-the-docs">CurveZMQ</a> encryption protocol if encryption is set.
<ul>
<li>Using <a href="http://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a>. this means setting the socketopts <code>ZMQ_CURVE_SERVER</code> to 1 and <code>ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY</code> to the secret key before binding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MUST listen for and accept TCP connections.
<ul>
<li>For an IP NetAddress, bind on the given host IP and port.</li>
<li>For an Onion NetAddress, bind on 127.0.0.1 and the given port.</li>
<li>For an I2P NetAddress, as yet undetermined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MUST read multipart messages and return them to the caller.
<ul>
<li>If the timeout is reached, return an error to be handled by the calling code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="outboundconnection"><a class="header" href="#outboundconnection">OutboundConnection</a></h4>
<p>A thin wrapper around a <code>ZMQ_DEALER</code> socket, which connects to a <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#netaddress">NetAddress</a> and sends outbound multipart messages.
This connection blocks until data can be written, or a timeout is reached. The timeout should never be reached, as
<a href="http://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a> internally queues messages to be sent.</p>
<p>Fields may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a NetAddress;</li>
<li>underlying <a href="http://api.zeromq.org/2-1:zmq-socket">ZeroMQ socket</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>send(msg)</code></li>
<li><code>receive()</code></li>
<li><code>disconnect()</code></li>
<li><code>set_encryption(server_pk, client_pk, client_sk)</code></li>
<li><code>set_socks_proxy(address)</code></li>
<li><code>set_hwm(v)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>An OutboundConnection:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST perform the &quot;client-side&quot; <a href="http://curvezmq.org/page:read-the-docs">CurveZMQ</a> encryption protocol if encryption is set.
<ul>
<li>Using ZeroMQ, this means setting the socketopts <code>ZMQ_CURVE_SERVERKEY</code>, <code>ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY</code> and <code>ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLICKEY</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MUST connect to a TCP endpoint.
<ul>
<li>For an IP NetAddress, connect to the given host IP and port.</li>
<li>For an Onion NetAddress, connect to the onion address using the TCP, e.g. <code>tcp://xyz...123.onion:1234</code>.</li>
<li>For an I2P NetAddress, as yet undetermined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MUST write the parts of the given MessageEnvelope to the socket as a multipart message consisting of, in order:
<ul>
<li>identity;</li>
<li>version;</li>
<li>header;</li>
<li>body.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If specified, MUST set a High Water Mark (HWM) on the underlying ZeroMQ socket.</li>
<li>If the HWM is reached, a call to <code>send</code> MUST return an error and any messages received SHOULD be discarded.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="peer"><a class="header" href="#peer">Peer</a></h4>
<p>A single peer that can communicate on the Tari network.</p>
<p>Fields may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>addresses</code> - a list of <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#netaddress">NetAddress</a>es associated with the peer, perhaps accompanied by some bookkeeping metadata, such 
as preferred address;</li>
<li><code>node_type</code> - the type of node or client, i.e. <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">BaseNode</a>, <a href="Glossary.html#validator-node">ValidatorNode</a>, <a href="Glossary.html#wallet">Wallet</a> or <a href="Glossary.html#token-wallet">TokenWallet</a>);</li>
<li><code>last_seen</code> - a timestamp of the last time a message has been sent/received from this peer;</li>
<li><code>flags</code> - 8-bit flag;
<ul>
<li>bit 0: is_banned,</li>
<li>bit 1-7: reserved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A peer may also contain reputation metrics (e.g. rejected_message_count, avg_latency) to be used to decide
if a peer should be banned. This mechanism is yet to be decided.</p>
<h4 id="peerconnection"><a class="header" href="#peerconnection">PeerConnection</a></h4>
<p>Represents direct bidirectional connection to another node or client. As connections are bidirectional,
the PeerConnection need only hold a single <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#inboundconnection">InboundConnection</a> or <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#outboundconnection">OutboundConnection</a>, depending on if the
node requested a peer connect to it or if it is connecting to a peer.</p>
<p>PeerConnection will send messages to the peer in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner as long as the connection
is maintained.</p>
<p>It has a few important functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>managing the underlying network connections, with automatic reconnection if necessary;</li>
<li>forwarding incoming messages onto the given handler socket; and</li>
<li>sending outgoing messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike InboundConnection and OutboundConnection, which are essentially stateless,
<code>PeerConnection</code> maintains a particular <code>ConnectionState</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Idle</code> - the connection has not been established.</li>
<li><code>Connecting</code> - the connection is in progress.</li>
<li><code>Connected</code> - the connection has been established.</li>
<li><code>Suspended</code> - the connection has been suspended. Incoming messages will be discarded, calls to <code>send()</code> will error.</li>
<li><code>Dead</code> - the connection is no longer active because the connection was dropped.</li>
<li><code>Shutdown</code> - the connection is no longer active because it was shut down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fields may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a connection state;</li>
<li>a control socket;</li>
<li>a peer connection <code>NetAddress</code>;</li>
<li>a direction (either <code>Inbound</code> or <code>Outbound</code>);</li>
<li>a public key obtained from the connection negotiation;</li>
<li>(optional) SOCKS proxy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>establish()</code></li>
<li><code>shutdown()</code></li>
<li><code>suspend()</code></li>
<li><code>resume()</code></li>
<li><code>send(msg)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A <code>PeerConnection</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST listen for data on the given <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#netaddress">NetAddress</a> using an InboundConnection;</li>
<li>MUST sequentially try to connect to one of the peer's NetAddresses until one succeeds or all fail using an OutboundConnection;</li>
<li>MUST immediately reject and dispose of a multipart message not consisting of four parts, as detailed in MessageEnvelope;</li>
<li>MUST construct a MessageEnvelope from the multiple parts;</li>
<li>MUST pass the constructed MessageEnvelope to the message handler;</li>
<li>MUST transition to <code>Connecting</code> state and retry the connection, should a connection drop;</li>
<li>MUST send a <code>net::Disconnect</code> message and drop the connection when a shutdown signal is received.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="connectionmanager"><a class="header" href="#connectionmanager">ConnectionManager</a></h4>
<p>The ConnectionManager manages a set of live PeerConnections. It provides an abstraction for other components
to initiate and use PeerConnections without having to worry about attaching the new PeerConnection to message handlers.</p>
<p>It consists of a list of active peer connections and an <code>inproc</code> message handler socket. This socket is 'written to' whenever
a message is received from any active <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#peerconnection">PeerConnection</a> for other components to act on.</p>
<p>Methods may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>establish_connection(Peer)</code> - create and return a new PeerConnection;</li>
<li><code>disconnect(peer)</code> - disconnect a particular peer;</li>
<li><code>suspend()</code> - temporarily suspend connections;</li>
<li><code>resume()</code> - temporarily suspend connections;</li>
<li><code>shutdown</code> - cleanly shut down all PeerConnections.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ConnectionManager</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST call <code>suspend</code> on every PeerConnection if its <code>suspend</code> method is called;</li>
<li>MUST call <code>resume</code> on every PeerConnection if its <code>resume</code> method is called;</li>
<li>MUST call <code>shutdown</code> on every PeerConnection if its <code>shutdown</code> method is called</li>
<li>MUST create a new PeerConnection with the given Peer and NetAddress, when <code>establish_connection</code> is called;</li>
<li>MUST call <code>shutdown</code> on the PeerConnection and remove the connection for the given peer, when <code>disconnect(peer)</code> is called;</li>
<li>MAY disconnect peers if the connection has not been used for an extended period;</li>
<li>SHOULD disconnect the least recently used peer if the connection pool is greater than <code>max connections</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="controlservice"><a class="header" href="#controlservice">ControlService</a></h4>
<p>The purpose of this service is to negotiate a new secure PeerConnection.</p>
<p>The control service accepts a single message:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>peer::EstablishConnection(pk, curve_pk, net_address)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A ControlService:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST listen for connections on a predefined CONTROL PORT;</li>
<li>SHOULD deny connections from banned peers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The steps to establish a peer connection are as follows:</p>
<p>Alice wants to connect to Bob</p>
<ol>
<li>Alice creates a <code>PeerConnection</code> to which Bob can connect.
<ul>
<li>A new CURVE key pair is generated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alice connects to Bob's control server and Bob accepts the connection.</li>
<li>Alice sends a <code>peer::establish_connection</code> message, with:
<ul>
<li>the CURVE public key for the socket connection;</li>
<li>the node's public key corresponding to its <a href="Glossary.html#node-id">Node ID</a>; and</li>
<li>the <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#netaddress">NetAddress</a> of the new PeerConnection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bob accepts this request and opens a new <code>PeerConnnection</code> socket using Alice's CURVE public key.</li>
<li>Bob connects to the given NetAddress and sends a <code>peer::establish_connection</code> message.</li>
<li>If Alice accepts the connection, they can begin sending messages. If not, both sides terminate the connection.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="peermanager"><a class="header" href="#peermanager">PeerManager</a></h4>
<p>The PeerManager is responsible for managing the list of peers with which the node has previously interacted.
This list is called a routing table and is made up of <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#peer">Peer</a>s.</p>
<p>The PeerManager can</p>
<ul>
<li>add a peer to the routing table;</li>
<li>search for a peer given a node ID, public key or <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#netaddress">NetAddress</a>;</li>
<li>delete a peer from the list;</li>
<li>persist the peer list using a storage backend;</li>
<li>restore the peer list from the storage backend;</li>
<li>maintain lightweight views of peers, using a filter criterion, e.g. a list of peers that have been banned, i.e. a denylist; and</li>
<li>prune the routing table based on a filter criterion, e.g. last date seen.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="messagedispatcher"><a class="header" href="#messagedispatcher">MessageDispatcher</a></h4>
<p>The MessageContext contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>the requesting PeerConnection;</li>
<li>the MessageHeader;</li>
<li>the deserialized message;</li>
<li>the OutboundMessageService.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, all the tools the handler needs to interact with the network.</p>
<p>A MessageDispatcher is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>constructing the MessageContext;</li>
<li>finding the message handler that is associated with the MessageType;</li>
<li>passing the MessageContext to the handler; and</li>
<li>ignoring the message if the handler cannot be found.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="inboundmessageservice"><a class="header" href="#inboundmessageservice">InboundMessageService</a></h4>
<p>InboundMessageService is a service that receives messages over a non-blocking asynchronous socket and
determines what to do with it. There are three options: handle, forward and discard.</p>
<p>A pool of worker threads (with a configurable size) is started and each one listens for messages on its $1:n$ <code>inproc</code> message
socket. A <code>ZMQ_DEALER</code> socket is suggested for fair-queueing work amongst workers, who listen for work with a <code>ZMQ_REP</code>.
The workers read off this socket and process the messages.</p>
<p>An InboundMessageService:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST receive messages from all PeerConnections; and</li>
<li>MUST write the message to the worker socket.</li>
</ul>
<p>A worker:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST deserialize the MessageHeader.
<ul>
<li>If unable to deserialize, MUST discard the message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MUST check the message signature.
<ul>
<li>MUST discard the message if the signature is invalid.</li>
<li>MUST discard the message if the signature has been processed within the <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#duplicatemessagewindow">DuplicateMessageWindow</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the encryption flag is set:
<ul>
<li>MUST attempt to decrypt the message.
<ul>
<li>If successful, process and handle the message.</li>
<li>Otherwise, MUST forward the message using the <code>Random</code> BroadcastStrategy.</li>
<li>If the message is not encrypted, MUST discard it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the destination <a href="Glossary.html#node-id">node ID</a> is set:
<ul>
<li>If the destination matches this node's ID - process and handle the message.</li>
<li>If the destination does not match this node's ID - MUST forward the message using the <code>Closest</code> BroadcastStrategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the destination is not set
<ul>
<li>If the MessageType is a kind of propagation message:
<ul>
<li>MUST handle the message;</li>
<li>MUST forward the message using the <code>Random</code> BroadcastStrategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the MessageType is a kind of encrypted message:
<ul>
<li>MUST attempt to decrypt and handle the message;</li>
<li>if successful, MUST handle the message;</li>
<li>if unsuccessful, MUST forward the message using the <code>Random</code> or <code>Flood</code> BroadcastStrategy,</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="outboundmessageservice"><a class="header" href="#outboundmessageservice">OutboundMessageService</a></h4>
<p>OutboundMessageService is responsible for using the connection and peer infrastructure to
send messages to the rest of the network.</p>
<p>In particular, it is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>serializing the message body;</li>
<li>constructing the MessageEnvelope;</li>
<li>executing the required BroadcastStrategy; and</li>
<li>sending messages using the [ConnectionManager].</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual sending of messages can be requested via the public <code>send_message</code> method, which takes a
MessageHeader, MessageBody and BroadcastStrategy as parameters.</p>
<p><code>send_message</code> then selects an appropriate peer(s) from the ConnectionManager according to the
BroadcastStrategy and sends the message to each of the selected peers.</p>
<p>BroadcastStrategy determines how a set of peer nodes will be selected and can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Direct</code> - send to a particular peer matching the given <a href="Glossary.html#node-id">node ID</a>;</li>
<li><code>Flood</code> - send to all known peers who are not [communication clients];</li>
<li><code>Closest</code> - send to $n$ closest peers who are not [communication clients]; or</li>
<li><code>Random</code> - send to a random set of peers of size $n$ who are not [communication clients].</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="privacy-features"><a class="header" href="#privacy-features">Privacy Features</a></h3>
<p>The following privacy features are proposed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="Glossary.html#communication-node">communication node</a> or <a href="Glossary.html#communication-client">communication client</a> MAY communicate solely over the Tor/I2P networks.</li>
<li>All traffic (with the exception of the control service) MUST be encrypted.</li>
<li>Messages MAY encrypt the body of a MessageEnvelope, which only a particular recipient can decrypt.</li>
<li>The <code>destination</code> header field can be omitted when used in conjunction with body encryption; the destination is
completely unknown to the rest of the network.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="store-and-forward-strategy"><a class="header" href="#store-and-forward-strategy">Store and Forward Strategy</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes it may be desirable for messages to be sent without a destination node/client being online. This
is especially important for a modern chat/messaging application.</p>
<p>The mechanism for this is proposed as follows:</p>
<p>Each <a href="Glossary.html#communication-node">communication node</a> MUST allocate some disk space for storage of messages for offline recipients.
Only some allowlisted MessageTypes are permitted to be stored. A sender sends a message destined for a particular
<a href="Glossary.html#node-id">node ID</a> to its closest peers, which forward the message to their closest peers, and so on.</p>
<p>Eventually, the message will reach nodes that either know the destination or are very close to the destination.
These nodes MUST store the message in some pending message bucket for the destination. The maximum number of
buckets and the size of each bucket SHOULD be sufficiently large as to be unlikely to overflow, but not so
large as to approach disk space problems. Individual messages should be small and responsibilities for
storage spread over the entire network.</p>
<p>A communication node</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST store messages for later retransmission, if all of the following conditions are true:
<ul>
<li>the MessageType is permitted to be stored;</li>
<li>there are fewer than $n$ closer online peers to the destination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MUST retransmit pending messages when a closer peer comes online or is added to the routing table.</li>
<li>MAY remove a bucket, in any of the following conditions:
<ul>
<li>The bucket is empty;</li>
<li>A configured maximum number of buckets has been reached. Discard the bucket with the earliest creation timestamp.</li>
<li>The number of closer online peers to the destination is equal to or has exceeded $n$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MAY expire individual messages after a sufficiently long Time to Live (TTL)</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach has the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a destination comes online, it will receive pending messages without having to query them.</li>
<li>The &quot;closer within a threshold&quot; metric is simple.</li>
<li>Messages are stored on multiple peers, which makes it less likely for messages to disappear as nodes come and go
(depending on threshold $n$).</li>
</ul>

<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe the various types of versioning that nodes on the Tari network 
will use during interaction with other nodes.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="description-13"><a class="header" href="#description-13">Description</a></h2>
<p>In a decentralized system the set of nodes on the network will run a variety of software versions as time goes on. Some 
of these versions will be compatible and others not. For example, if a crucial consensus change is added during a hard 
fork event. Furthermore, there will be multiple networks running Tari code, i.e. Mainnet vs Testnet. Versioning refers 
to the strategies we will use for nodes to determine if they can communicate.</p>
<p>Tari will contain three different versioning schemes:</p>
<ol>
<li>WireMode is the first byte a peer sends when connecting to another peer, used to identify the network and/or protocol bytes that follow </li>
<li>P2P message versions that will accompany every P2P message,</li>
<li>Consensus rules versions that will be exchanged on connection and are included in each block header.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="wiremode-byte"><a class="header" href="#wiremode-byte">WireMode byte</a></h3>
<p>In the Bitcoin P2P protocol messages are preceded by 4 
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#Common_structures">magic values</a> or bytes. These values are used to 
delimit when a new message starts in a byte stream and also are used to indicate which of the Bitcoin networks the node 
is speaking on, such as TestNet or Mainnet.</p>
<p>Tari message packets are encapsulated using the Noise protocol so we do not need the delimiting functionality of these 
bytes but Tari will include a single WireMode byte at the beginning of every connection session. This byte will indicate 
which network a node is communicating on, so that if the counterparty is on a different network it can reject this 
connection cheaply without having to perform any further operations, like completing the Noise protocol handshake.</p>
<p>The following is a proposed mapping of the WireMode byte. Space is left between Mainnet, Stagenet and Testnet bytes for
future use. </p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">   #[repr(u8)]
   enum Network {
      Mainnet = 0x00,
      Stagenet1 = 0x51,
      Testnet1 = 0xa1,
      Testnet2 = 0xa2
   }
</code></pre>
<h3 id="p2p-message-version"><a class="header" href="#p2p-message-version">P2P message version</a></h3>
<p>Peer to Peer messages on the Tari network are encapsulated into message envelopes. The body of message envelopes are 
defined, serialized and deserialized using Protobuf. These messages will only be updated by adding new fields to the 
Protobuf definitions, never removing fields. This is done in order to preserve backwards compatibility where newer nodes 
can still communicate with older nodes. </p>
<p>The P2P messaging protocol will see many changes in its lifetime. Some will be minor changes that are fully backwards 
compatible and some changes will be breaking where older nodes will not be able to communicate with newer nodes. In 
order to document these two classes of changes each P2P message header will contain a <code>version</code> field that will use
a two-part semantic versioning scheme with the format of <code>major.minor</code> integer versions. The <code>minor</code> version will be 
incremented whenever there is any change. The <code>major</code> version be incremented when there is a breaking change made to 
the P2P protocol. Each integer can be stored separately.</p>
<h3 id="consensus-version"><a class="header" href="#consensus-version">Consensus version</a></h3>
<p>The final aspect of the Tari system that will be versioned are the Consensus rules. These rules will change as the 
network matures. Changes to consensus rules can be achieved using either a Soft fork or Hard fork. Soft forks are where 
new consensus rules are added that older nodes will see as valid (thus backwards compatible) but newer nodes will reject 
blocks from older nodes that are not aware of the new consensus rules. A hard fork means that the new consensus rules 
are not backwards compatible and so only nodes that know about the new rules will be able to produce and validate new 
transactions and blocks.</p>
<p>The consensus version will be used by a node to determine if it can interact with another node successfully or not. A 
list of fork versions will be maintained within the code. When a connection is started with a new node the two nodes 
will exchange <code>Version</code> messages detailing the consensus version they are each running and the blockheight at which they
are currently operating. Both nodes will need to reply with a <code>Version Acknowledge</code> message to confirm that they are 
compatible with the counterparty's version. It is possible for a newer node to downgrade its protocol to speak to an 
older node so this must be decided during this handshake process. Only once the acknowledgments have been exchanged can 
further messages be exchanged by the parties. This is the method currently employed on the 
<a href="https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/p2p_network.html#connecting-to-peers">Bitcoin network</a></p>
<p>For example, if we have two nodes, Node A and Node B, where Node A is ahead of Node B in version and block height. 
During the handshake Node B will not recognize Node A's version but should wait for Node A to reject or confirm the
connection because Node A could potentially downgrade their version to match Node B's. Node A will speak to Node B if
and only if Node A recognizes Node B's version and Node B's block height is in the correct range for its advertised 
version according to Node A's fork version list.</p>
<p>Tari Block Headers contain a <code>version</code> field which will be used to indicate the version of consensus rules that are 
used in the construction and validation of this block. Consensus rules versions will only consist of breaking changes
and as such will be represented with a single incremented integer. This coupled with the internal list of fork versions,
that includes the height at which they came into effect, will be used to validate whether the consensus rules specified 
in the header are valid for that block's height.</p>

<p>This Request for Comment (RFC) presents a proposal for Bulletproof range proof rewinding in the Tari blockchain to 
enable advanced usages like wallet recovery and one‑sided payments.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>We use <code>dalek-cryptography/bulletproofs</code> in the Tari project and have a need to do wallet recovery from seed values and 
also to recover the value in the value commitment from the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO). Pull requests 
<a href="https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/bulletproofs/pull/340">PR#340</a> for the <code>dalek-cryptography/bulletproofs</code> crate 
and <a href="https://github.com/zkcrypto/bulletproofs/pull/6">PR#6</a> for the <code>zkcrypto/bulletproofs</code> crate were submitted to add 
Bulletproofs rewinding functionality to the Bulletproofs crate as a user option.</p>
<p>The methodology presented here is closely modelled on Grin's solution 
<a href="https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-wallet/issues/105">as discussed here</a>, but using two private keys instead of one.</p>
<h2 id="rewind-scheme"><a class="header" href="#rewind-scheme">Rewind Scheme</a></h2>
<p>Bulletproofs per say are not be discussed in this RFC, only how the rewinding scheme works. Readers who require 
background information on Bulletproofs can read the excellent documentation created by the Dalek team 
<a href="https://doc-internal.dalek.rs/bulletproofs/index.html">here</a>. Important to note is that Dalek only implemented 
the aggregated Multiparty Computation Protocol (MCP) for range proofs and that proving a single range proof is handled a 
special case.</p>
<h3 id="constructing-a-rewindable-bulletproof-range-proof"><a class="header" href="#constructing-a-rewindable-bulletproof-range-proof">Constructing a rewindable Bulletproof range proof</a></h3>
<p>Our scheme is discussed with reference to the 
<a href="https://doc-internal.dalek.rs/bulletproofs/range_proof/index.html#party-and-dealers-algorithm">Party and Dealer's algorithm</a>
and using notation defined <a href="https://doc-internal.dalek.rs/bulletproofs/notes/index.html#notation">here</a>.</p>
<p>In this scheme three additional parameters are introduced when creating a range proof for a Pedersen commitment 
(termed <em>value commitment</em> by Dalek because it is a commitment to the value of the token):</p>
<ul>
<li>Private rewind key:   $ r_{key} $</li>
<li>Private blinding key:   $ b_{key} $</li>
<li>Twenty three (23) bytes proof message:   $ p_{msg} $.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 23 bytes worth of proof message can be any message a user wants to embed within the proof. Internally the two 
private keys, in combination with the value commitment, are converted into two rewind nonces and two blinding nonces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rewind nonce 1:   $ r_{n1} = \text{H}( \ \text{H}(r_{key} \cdot \widetilde{B}) \ || \ V_{(j)} \ ) $</li>
<li>Rewind nonce 2:   $ r_{n2} = \text{H}( \ \text{H}(b_{key} \cdot \widetilde{B}) \ || \ V_{(j)} \ ) $</li>
<li>Blinding nonce 1:   $ b_{n1} = \text{H}( \ \text{H}(r_{key}) \ || \ V_{(j)} \ ) $</li>
<li>Blinding nonce 2:   $ b_{n2} = \text{H}( \ \text{H}(b_{key}) \ || \ V_{(j)} \ ) $</li>
</ul>
<p>These four values are seen as nonces due to the fact that each value commitment is unique, whereas the $ r_{key} $ 
and $ b_{key} $ can be used over and over without leaking any information. </p>
<p>The value $ v_{(j)} $ is an 8 byte word, and $ p_{msg} $ is a 23 byte word. The bytes of these two words can be 
concatenated to form a 32 byte word and when XORed with $ r_{n2} $ ,  it can be used to embed the value and proof message. $ r_{n2} $ is modified as follows:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
r^\backprime_{n2}  = r_{n2} \ \mathbin{\oplus} \ (v_{(j)_{\ bytes \ 1..8}}  \ || \ p_{msg_{\ bytes \ 9..31}} )
\end{aligned}
\tag{1}
$$</p>
<p>Consider the start of the protocol where each party $ j $ computes three commitments: to the value $ v_{(j)} $, to the 
bits of that value $ \mathbf{a}_{L, (j)}, \mathbf{a}_{R, (j)} $, and to the per-bit blinding factors 
$ \mathbf{s}_{L, (j)}, \mathbf{s}_{R, (j)} $:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
V_{(j)} &amp;\gets \operatorname{Com}(v_{(j)}, {\widetilde{v}_{(j)}})               &amp;&amp; = v_{(j)} \cdot B + {\widetilde{v}_{(j)}} \cdot {\widetilde{B}} \\
A_{(j)} &amp;\gets \operatorname{Com}({\mathbf{a}}_{L, (j)}, {\mathbf{a}}_{R, (j)}) &amp;&amp; = {\langle {\mathbf{a}}_{L, (j)}, {\mathbf{G}_{(j)}} \rangle} + {\langle {\mathbf{a}}_{R, (j)}, {\mathbf{H}_{(j)}} \rangle} + {\widetilde{a}_{(j)}} {\widetilde{B}} \\
S_{(j)} &amp;\gets \operatorname{Com}({\mathbf{s}}_{L, (j)}, {\mathbf{s}}_{R, (j)}) &amp;&amp; = {\langle {\mathbf{s}}_{L, (j)}, {\mathbf{G}_{(j)}} \rangle} + {\langle {\mathbf{s}}_{R, (j)}, {\mathbf{H}_{(j)}} \rangle} + {\widetilde{s}_{(j)}} {\widetilde{B}} \\
\end{aligned}
\tag{2}
$$</p>
<p>where $ \widetilde{v}_{(j)}, \widetilde{a}_{(j)}, \widetilde{s}_{(j)} $ are sampled randomly from $ {\mathbb Z_p} $. 
(Note that $ \widetilde{v}_{(j)} $ is the blinding factor of the value commitment.)</p>
<p>In our scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>blinding factor $ {\widetilde{a}_{(j)}} $ is replaced by $ r_{n1} $</li>
<li>blinding factor $ {\widetilde{s}_{(j)}} $ is replaced by $ r^\backprime_{n2} $</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider where the party commits to the terms $ t_{1, (j)}, t_{2, (j)} $:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{1, (j)} &amp;\gets \operatorname{Com}(t_{1, (j)}, {\tilde{t}_{(j1}})  &amp;&amp; = t_{1, (j)} \cdot B + {\tilde{t}_{1, (j)}} \cdot {\widetilde{B}} \\
T_{2, (j)} &amp;\gets \operatorname{Com}(t_{2, (j)}, {\tilde{t}_{2, (j)}})  &amp;&amp; = t_{2, (j)} \cdot B + {\tilde{t}_{2, (j)}} \cdot {\widetilde{B}}
\end{aligned}
\tag{3}
$$</p>
<p>where $ \tilde{t}_{1, (j)}, \tilde{t}_{2, (j)} $ are sampled randomly from $ {\mathbb Z_p} $.</p>
<p>In our scheme:</p>
<ol>
<li>blinding factor $ \tilde{t}_{1, (j)} $ is replaced by $ b_{n1} $</li>
<li>blinding factor $ \tilde{t}_{2, (j)} $ is replaced by $ b_{n2} $</li>
</ol>
<p>The synthetic blinding factors calculation below is key, as it will be used to extract the data when playing the 
Bulletproof in reverse:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
{\tilde{t}}_{(j)}(x) &amp;\gets z^{2} {\tilde{v}}_{(j)} + x {\tilde{t}}_{1, (j)} + x^{2} {\tilde{t}}_{2, (j)} \\
\end{aligned}
\tag{4}
$$</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{e}_{(j)}     &amp;\gets {\widetilde{a}}_{(j)}   + x {\widetilde{s}}_{(j)}
\end{aligned}
\tag{5}
$$</p>
<p>In the end, the complete range proof consists of these elements:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\lbrace A, S, T_1, T_2, t(x), {\tilde{t}}(x), \tilde{e}, L_k, R_k, \dots, L_1, R_1, a, b \rbrace 
\end{aligned}
\tag{6}
$$</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This scheme has been improved in what has been presented in by 
<a href="https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-wallet/issues/105">Grin</a> after being commented on by Dalek, by not using the same 
rewind nonce for $ {\widetilde{a}_{(j)}} $ and $ {\widetilde{s}_{(j)}} $ nor the same blinding nonce for 
$ \tilde{t}_{1, (j)} $ and $ \tilde{t}_{2, (j)} $.</p>
<h3 id="extracting-data"><a class="header" href="#extracting-data">Extracting data</a></h3>
<p>Note the presence of $ {\tilde{t}}_{(j)} $ and $ \tilde{e} $ in (6). The Dalek Bulletproofs are constructed using 
<a href="https://doc-internal.dalek.rs/merlin/index.html">Merlin Transcripts</a> to automate the Fiat-Shamir transform, so that 
non-interactive protocols can be implemented as if they were interactive. The prover adds each step of the Bulletproof 
range proof creation to the protocol transcript, so the verifier has to do the same.</p>
<p>The extraction procress starts by adding the values $ A $ and $ S $ are to the protocol transcript to obtain challenge 
scalars $ z $ and $ x $ from the transcript.</p>
<p>There after, $ {\widetilde{s}_{(j)}} $ is extracted from (5) by replacing $ {\widetilde{a}_{(j)}} $ with $ r_{n1} $  :</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
{\widetilde{s}}_{(j)} = ( \tilde{e}_{(j)} - r_{n1} ) \cdot \frac{1}x 
\end{aligned}
\tag{7}
$$</p>
<p>Next, the value and proof message are extracted from $ {\widetilde{s}_{(j)}} $ when XORed with $ r_{n2} $ :</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{(j)} &amp;= ( r_{n2} \ \mathbin{\oplus} \ {\widetilde{s}}_{(j)} ) | _{\ bytes \ 1..8} \\
p_{msg} &amp;= ( r_{n2} \ \mathbin{\oplus} \ {\widetilde{s}}_{(j)} ) | _{\ bytes \ 9..31} 
\end{aligned}
\tag{8}
$$</p>
<p>Finally, the blinding factor is extracted from (4):</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\widetilde{v} = \frac{1}{z^2} \cdot ( {\tilde{t}}(x) - x \cdot \tilde{t}_{1, (j)} - x^2 \cdot \tilde{t}_{2, (j)} )
\end{aligned}
\tag{9}
$$</p>
<h2 id="some-notes-on-usage-and-use-cases"><a class="header" href="#some-notes-on-usage-and-use-cases">Some notes on usage and use cases</a></h2>
<p>Rewinding a Bulletproof can take place according to one or both of these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Peak value only:</strong> Using this step returns the value and proof message only, but <em>returning garbage data if 
the wrong rewind nonces are provided</em>, or,</li>
<li><strong>Rewind fully:</strong> Using this step returns the value, blinding factor and proof message, <em>returning an error if 
the wrong rewind and blinding nonces are provided</em>. Note that this step is independent from peaking the value only, 
thus do not have ot be preceded by it. If many range proofs need to be scanned to uncover those that belong to a 
particuler wallet, peaking the value only before fully rewinfing it will provide a performance benefit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main use case has to do with wallet recovery. A user would normally have a backup of their unique wallet seed 
words somewhere, but could more easily lose their entire wallet without having made any backups or only having old 
backups. If a wallet can derive one or more sets of private keys from the seed words and use them in every UTXO 
construction as proposed, it can enable wallet recovery using Bulletproof rewinding.</p>
<p>A secondary use case would be for trusted 3rd parties to identify spending, by only having access to the public rewind 
key and the embedded proof message. The public rewind keys can be shared with a 3rd party out of band. The owner and/or 
delegated 3rd party can then use these keys in conjunction with a specific value commitment to calculate candidate 
rewind nonces for its proof. The returned proof message from the <em>peak value only</em> rewind step can be used to narrow 
down the probability that the particular proof belongs to a specific collection. In this mode the owner alone will be 
able to use both sets of pub-pvt key pairs in conjunction with a specific value commitment to calculate candidate rewind 
and blinding nonces for its proof. The <em>rewind fully</em> step will reveal the details of the value commitment and proof 
message if successful.</p>
<p>The use for this protocol, as opposed to simply revealing the original value along with the blinding factor to whoever 
wants the plain value, is to protect the UTXO. In Mimblewimble, if the value commitment can be opened, it can be spent 
without the owners knowledge.</p>
<p>The proof message is private or can be shared with a trusted 3rd party in the same way one would share the public 
rewind keys, but not common public knowledge. It is totally arbitrary, but known data, to enable identifying beyond a 
doubt if the returned value $ v_{(j)} $ is from a specific collection of value commitments $ V_{(j)} $.</p>
<h2 id="implementation"><a class="header" href="#implementation">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>Using the Application Programmers Interface (API) it is possible to:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a rewindable Zero-knowledge (ZK) proof with up to 23 bytes of additional embedded proof message  $ p_{msg} $ 
 ;</li>
<li>extract the value $ v_{(j)} $ and 23 bytes proof messsage $ p_{msg} $ only;</li>
<li>extract the value $ v_{(j)} $  ,   blinding factor $ \widetilde{v} $ and 23 bytes proof messsage $ p_{msg} $

<ul>
<li>Each <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">base node</a> is connected to a number of peers that maintain their own copies of the Mempool.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="abstract-2"><a class="header" href="#abstract-2">Abstract</a></h3>
<p>The Mempool is responsible for managing, verifying and maintaining all unconfirmed transactions that have not yet 
been included in a <a href="Glossary.html#block">block</a> and added to the Tari <a href="Glossary.html#blockchain">blockchain</a>. It consists of a Transaction Pool, Pending Pool, 
Orphan Pool and Reorg Pool to achieve these tasks. It is also responsible for propagating valid transactions and 
sharing the Mempool state with connected peers. An overview of the required functionality for the Mempool and each 
of its component pools will be provided.</p>
<h3 id="overview-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-1">Overview</a></h3>
<p>Every base node maintains a Mempool that consists of four separate pools: the Transaction Pool, Pending Pool, 
Orphan Pool and Reorg Pool. These four pools have different tasks and work together to form the Mempool used 
for maintaining unconfirmed transactions. </p>
<p>This is the role descriptions for each component pool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transaction Pool: contains all unconfirmed transactions that have been verified, have passed all checks, that 
only spend valid <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>s and don't have any time-lock restrictions.</li>
<li>Pending Pool: contains unconfirmed transactions that have time-lock restrictions. The transactions in this pool 
either attempt to spend UTXOs with time-locks or the transactions themselves have time-locks limiting them from 
being included in new blocks until a specified future time or block height has been reached. </li>
<li>Orphan Pool: out of order unconfirmed transactions are managed by this pool, these transactions attempt to spend 
non-existent UTXOs.</li>
<li>Reorg Pool: stores a backup of all transactions that have recently been included into blocks, in case a blockchain 
reorganization occurs and these transactions have to be restored to the Transaction Pool so that they can be included 
in future blocks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prioritizing-unconfirmed-transactions"><a class="header" href="#prioritizing-unconfirmed-transactions">Prioritizing Unconfirmed Transactions</a></h3>
<p>The maximum storage capacity used for storing unconfirmed transactions by the Mempool and each of its component pools 
can be configured. If a new transaction is received and the storage capacity limits have been reached, then 
transactions are prioritized according to the transaction priority metric. The transaction priority metric consist 
of the fees and the maturity of the UTXOs being spent by the transaction and should be applied to determine the priority 
of each transaction in the Mempool. As the allocated storage space of the Mempool becomes limited, the transactions 
with the highest priority are kept in the pool. The lowest priority transactions are discarded to make room for 
higher priority incoming transactions.</p>
<p>The transaction priority metric has the following behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transactions spending UTXOs with higher block height maturity SHOULD be prioritized over transactions spending UTXOs 
with lower block height maturity.</li>
<li>Transactions with higher fees per transaction message size SHOULD be prioritized over lower fee transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="syncing-and-updating-of-the-memory-pool-state"><a class="header" href="#syncing-and-updating-of-the-memory-pool-state">Syncing and Updating of the Memory Pool State</a></h3>
<p>On the initial startup of the Mempool, the complete state of the Mempool that consists of the Transaction Pool, Pending 
Pool, Orphan Pool and Reorg Pool can be requested and downloaded from the connected peers. A memory pool typically 
doesn't make use of persistent storage but could be configured to keep a backup of the last known state. If an existing 
Mempool state is locally available then a more efficient update process can be performed by requesting only the 
unconfirmed transactions missing from the current Mempool state. When no state is available then the entire Mempool 
state must be downloaded from the connected peers. During downloading or updating of the Mempool state, the validity 
of all transaction in the pool must be verified and the priority of each transaction must be calculated. </p>
<p>Functional behavior required for sharing and updating of the Mempool state, and propagation of transactions between peers:</p>
<ul>
<li>All verified transaction MUST be propagated to neighboring peers.</li>
<li>Duplicate transactions MUST NOT be propagated to peers.</li>
<li>Unvalidated or invalid transactions MUST NOT be propagated to peers.</li>
<li>Verified transactions that were discarded due to low priority levels MUST be propagated to peers.</li>
<li>The Mempool MUST have an interface that can be used by neighboring peers to query the content and state of the memory 
pool.</li>
<li>It MUST have a mechanism that enables peers to download the memory pool state in full or in part.</li>
<li>It MUST accept all transactions received from peers but MAY decide to discard low priority transactions.</li>
<li>It MUST allow wallets to track payments by monitoring that a particular transaction has been added to the Mempool.</li>
<li>A Mempool MAY choose:
<ul>
<li>to discard the Mempool state on restarts and then download the full state from its peers or</li>
<li>to store the state of the Mempool using persistent storage to reduce communication bandwidth required when 
reinitializing the Mempool after a restart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="transaction-pool"><a class="header" href="#transaction-pool">Transaction Pool</a></h3>
<p>The Transaction Pool consists of all unconfirmed transactions that have been received, verified and have passed 
all checks. These unconfirmed transactions in the Transaction Pool are ready to be included and can be used to 
construct new blocks for the Tari blockchain.</p>
<p>Functional behavior required of the Transaction Pool:</p>
<ul>
<li>It MUST verify that incoming transactions only spend existing UTXOs.</li>
<li>It MUST ensure that incoming transactions don't have a processing time-lock or has a time-lock that has 
expired.</li>
<li>It MUST ensure that all time-locks of the UTXOs that will be spent by the transaction have expired.</li>
<li>Transactions that have been used to construct new blocks MUST be removed from the Transaction Pool and added to the Reorg Pool.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pending-pool"><a class="header" href="#pending-pool">Pending Pool</a></h3>
<p>The Pending Pool contains all transactions that are restricted by time-locks. A transaction could have a time-lock 
limiting it from being processed or it can attempt to spend UTXOs with time-locks. These transactions require 
their time-locks or the time-locks of the input UTXOs to expire before they can be processed and included into new 
blocks. All transactions in the Pending Pool have been verified and passed all checks except their own time-lock has 
not yet expired or some of the UTXOs that will be spent have time-lock restrictions that are not yet valid. Once the 
transactions time-lock or the time-locks on the UTXOs have expired then the Pending Pool transactions can be moved 
to the Transaction Pool for inclusion in future blocks.</p>
<p>Functional behavior required of the Pending Pool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the transaction time-lock or UTXO time-lock restricting the processing of a transaction has expired then the 
pending transaction MUST be moved to the Transaction Pool.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="orphan-pool"><a class="header" href="#orphan-pool">Orphan Pool</a></h3>
<p>The Orphan Pool contains all the received transactions that have passed all the verification steps and checks, except 
they attempt to spend UTXOs that don't exist. A possible reason these UTXOs do not yet exist is that they may not yet 
have been created and might exist in the future. Typically, these orphaned transactions are from a series or bundle of 
transactions that need to be processed in a specific order but</p>
<ul>
<li>have been either received out of order,</li>
<li>or the order of processing the bundled transactions might not have been known or specified.</li>
</ul>
<p>As transactions are processed and the missing UTXOs have been created, then the orphaned transactions can be moved 
to the Transaction Pool for possible inclusion in future blocks. Another possibility why the input UTXOs might not 
be available is that the UTXOs were double spent by other transactions. In time, the double spent transactions will 
be discarded from the Orphan Pool once they have reached the appropriate maturity threshold.</p>
<p>Functional behavior required of the Orphan Pool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each newly received transaction MUST be verified and pass all checks except the UTXO validity check before it is 
placed in the Orphan Pool.</li>
<li>Orphaned transactions must be upgraded and moved to the Transaction Pool once the previously unavailable UTXOs become 
available.</li>
<li>Orphaned transactions that have surpassed the expiration time threshold MUST be removed from the Orphan Pool.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reorg-pool"><a class="header" href="#reorg-pool">Reorg Pool</a></h3>
<p>The Reorg Pool consists of all unconfirmed transaction that have recently been added to blocks, resulting in 
their removal from the Transaction Pool. When a potential blockchain reorganization occurs that invalidates previously 
assembled blocks, the transactions used to construct these discarded blocks can be recovered from the Reorg Pool and 
can be added back into the Transaction Pool. This will ensure that high priority transactions are not lost during 
blockchain reorganization but can be added into future blocks without retransmission of these transactions.</p>
<p>Functional behavior required of the Reorg Pool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copies of the verified transactions removed from the Transaction pool that were placed in blocks MUST be stored in 
the Reorg Pool.</li>
<li>Transactions in the Reorg pool MAY be removed after the threshold expiration time has been reached. </li>
<li>When a blockchain reorganization is detected, all affected transactions from the Reorg Pool MUST be moved to the 
Transaction Pool.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mempool-1"><a class="header" href="#mempool-1">Mempool</a></h3>
<p>The Mempool manages the four component pools and interacts with peers to share and retrieve transactions and 
the Mempool state. During the operation of the Mempool it will distribute incoming transactions to the appropriate 
component pools. When a new incoming transaction is received a number of checks and verification steps need to be performed 
to determine if the transaction can be added to the Mempool and determine which of the component pools should be responsible 
for that particular transaction. Only when the new transaction has passed these checks can it be added to the Mempool and 
should it be propagated to the connected peers.</p>
<p>Functional behavior required of the Mempool:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a duplicate transaction is received, that already exist in the Mempool, then the duplicate copy MUST be discarded.</li>
<li>When considering transactions that attempt to double spend UTXOs, the highest priority transaction MUST be kept and any 
other transactions that spend the same UTXO MUST be discarded.</li>
<li>When the storage limit of the Mempool has been reached, new incoming transactions SHOULD be prioritized according to the 
Priority metric.</li>
<li>Lower priority Mempool transactions MUST be discarded to make room for higher priority incoming transactions.</li>
<li>Incoming transactions with lower priorities than the minimum transaction priority in the Mempool MUST be discarded.</li>
<li>The Mempool MUST verify that incoming transactions do not have duplicate outputs.</li>
<li>It MUST check that all coinbase outputs that will be spent have matured sufficiently.</li>
<li>The distribution of storage space allocated to each component pool in the memory pool MAY be configured and adjusted.</li>
<li>The memory pool SHOULD have a mechanism to estimate fee categories from the current Mempool state. As an example, 
a priority fee can be estimated that will ensure that a new transactions will have the appropriate priority to be added 
into a new block in a timely manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Functional behavior required for distributing incoming transactions to the component pools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified transactions that have passed all checks such as spending of valid UTXOs and expired time-locks MUST be 
placed in the Transaction Pool</li>
<li>All transactions that attempt to spend UTXOs with valid time-locks MUST be added to the Pending Pool.</li>
<li>Incoming transactions with time-locks prohibiting them from being included into new blocks should be added to the 
Pending Pool.</li>
<li>Newly received verified transaction attempting to spend a UTXO that does not yet exist MUST be added to the Orphan 
pool.</li>
<li>Transactions that have been added to blocks and were removed from the Transaction Pool should be added to the Reorg Pool.</li>

<h2 id="introduction-2"><a class="header" href="#introduction-2">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>It is hopefully clear to anyone reading these RFCs that the ambitions of the Tari project extend beyond a
Mimblewimble-clone-coin.
It should also be fairly clear that vanilla Mimblewimble does not have the feature set to provide functionality such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-sided payments</li>
<li>Multiparty side-chain peg outs and peg-ins</li>
<li>Generalised smart contracts</li>
</ul>
<p>Extensions to Mimblewimble have been proposed for most of these features, for example, David Burkett's one-sided payment
proposal for LiteCoin (<a href="https://github.com/DavidBurkett/lips/blob/master/lip-0004.mediawiki">LIP-004</a>), this project's <a href="RFC-0230_HTLC.html">HTLC RFC</a> and the pegging proposals for the
Clacks side-chain.</p>
<p>Some smart contract features are possible, or partly possible in vanilla [Mimblewimble] using <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/scriptless-scripts/introduction-to-scriptless-scripts.html">Scriptless script</a>, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomic swaps </li>
<li>Hash time-locked contracts</li>
</ul>
<p>This RFC makes the case that if Tari were to implement a scripting language similar to Bitcoin script, then all of these
use cases will collapse and can be achieved under a single set of (relatively minor) modifications and additions to the
current Tari and Mimblewimble protocol.</p>
<h2 id="scripting-on-mimblewimble"><a class="header" href="#scripting-on-mimblewimble">Scripting on Mimblewimble</a></h2>
<p>To the author's knowledge, none of existing [Mimblewimble] projects have employed a scripting language, nor are there 
ambitions to do so. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin">Grin</a> styles itself as a &quot;Minimal implementation of the Mimblewimble protocol&quot;,
so one might infer that this status is unlikely to change soon.</p>
<p>Beam <a href="https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/Beam-Smart-Contracts">recently announced</a> the inclusion of a smart contract
protocol, which allows users to execute arbitrary code (shaders) in a sandboxed Beam VM and have the results of that 
code interact with transactions.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mwcproject/mwc-node/blob/master/doc/roadmap.md">Mimblewimble coin</a> is a fork of Grin and &quot;considers
the protocol ossified&quot;.</p>
<p>Litecoin is in the process of adding Mimblewimble as a
<a href="https://github.com/litecoin-project/lips/blob/master/lip-0003.mediawiki">side-chain</a>. As of this writing, there appear
to be no plans to include general scripting into the protocol.</p>
<h3 id="scriptless-scripts"><a class="header" href="#scriptless-scripts">Scriptless scripts</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/scriptless-scripts/introduction-to-scriptless-scripts.html">Scriptless script</a> is a wonderfully elegant technology and inclusion of <a href="Glossary.html#tariscript">TariScript</a> does not preclude the use of
Scriptless script in Tari. However, scriptless scripts have some disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are often difficult to reason about, with the result that the development of features based on scriptless scripts
is essentially in the hands of a very select group of cryptographers and developers.</li>
<li>The use case set is impressive considering that the &quot;scripts&quot; are essentially signature wrangling, but is still 
somewhat limited.</li>
<li>Every feature must be written and implemented separately using the specific and specialised protocol designed for that
feature. That is, it cannot be used as a dynamic scripting framework on a running blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tariscript---a-brief-motivation"><a class="header" href="#tariscript---a-brief-motivation">TariScript - a brief motivation</a></h2>
<p>The essential idea of <a href="Glossary.html#tariscript">TariScript</a> is as follows:</p>
<p>Given a standard Tari UTXO, we add <em>additional restrictions</em> on whether that UTXO can be included as a valid input in a
transaction.</p>
<p>As long as those conditions are suitably committed to, are not malleable throughout the existence of the UTXO, and one
can prove that the script came from the UTXO owner, then these conditions are not that different to the 
requirement of having range proofs attached to UTXOs, which require that the value of Tari commitments is non-negative.</p>
<p>This argument is independent of the nature of the additional restrictions. Specifically, if these restrictions are
manifested as a script that provides additional constraints over whether a UTXO may be spent, the same arguments apply.</p>
<p>This means that in a very hand-wavy sort of way, there ought to be no reason that TariScript is not workable.</p>
<p>Note that range proofs can be discarded after a UTXO is spent. This entails that the global security guarantees of
Mimblewimble are not that every transaction in history was valid from an inflation perspective, but that the net effect
of all transactions lead to zero spurious inflation. This sounds worse than it is, since locally, every individual
transaction is checked for validity at the time of inclusion in the blockchain.</p>
<p>If it somehow happened that two illegal transactions made it into the blockchain (perhaps due to a bug), and the two
cancelled each other out such that the global coin supply was still correct, one would never know this when doing a
chain synchronisation in pruned mode.</p>
<p>But if there was a steady inflation bug due to invalid range proofs making it into the blockchain, a pruned mode sync
would still detect that <em>something</em> was awry, because the global coin supply balance acts as another check.</p>
<p>With TariScript, once the script has been pruned away, and then there is a re-org to an earlier point on the chain,
then there's no way to ensure that the script was honoured unless you run an archival node.</p>
<p>This is broadly in keeping with the Mimblewimble security guarantees that, in pruned-mode synchronisation, individual 
transactions are not necessarily verified during chain synchronisation.</p>
<p>However, the guarantee that no additional coins are created or destroyed remains intact.</p>
<p>Put another way, the blockchain relies on the network <em>at the time</em> to enforce the TariScript spending rules. 
This means that the scheme may be susceptible to certain <em>horizon attacks</em>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, a single honest archival node would be able to detect any fraud on the same chain and provide a simple 
proof that a transaction did not honour the redeem script.</p>
<h3 id="additional-requirements"><a class="header" href="#additional-requirements">Additional requirements</a></h3>
<p>The assumptions that broadly equate scripting with range proofs in the above argument are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The script must be committed to the blockchain.</li>
<li>The script must not be malleable in any way without invalidating the transaction. This restriction extends to all 
participants, including the UTXO owner.</li>
<li>We must be able to prove that the UTXO originator provides the script and no-one else.</li>
<li>The scripts and their redeeming inputs must be stored on the block chain. In particular, the input data must not be
malleable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next section discusses the specific proposals for achieving these requirements.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-modifications"><a class="header" href="#protocol-modifications">Protocol modifications</a></h2>
<p>Please refer to <a href="RFC-0201_TariScript.html#notation">Notation</a>, which provides important pre-knowledge for the remainder of the report.</p>
<p>At a high level, TariScript works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The spending <em>script</em> \((\script)\) is recorded in the transaction UTXO.</li>
<li>UTXOs also define a new, <em><a href="Glossary.html#sender-offset-keypair">sender offset</a> public key</em> \((K_{O})\).</li>
<li>After the <em>script</em> \((\script)\) is executed, the execution stack must contain exactly one value that will be 
interpreted as the <em><a href="Glossary.html#script-keypair">script public key</a></em> \((K_{S})\). One can prove ownership of a UTXO by demonstrating knowledge 
of both the commitment <em>blinding factor</em> \((k\)), <em>and</em> the <em><a href="Glossary.html#script-keypair">script private key</a></em> \((k_{S})\).</li>
<li>The <em>script private key</em> \((k_{S})\), commitment <em>blinding factor</em> \((k)\) and commitment <em>value</em> \((v)\) signs 
the <em>script input data</em> \((\input)\).</li>
<li>The <em>sender offset private keys</em> \((k_{O})\) and <em>script private keys</em> \((k_{S})\) are used in conjunction to 
create a <em>script offset</em> \((\so)\), which are used in the consensus balance to prevent a number of attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="utxo-data-commitments"><a class="header" href="#utxo-data-commitments">UTXO data commitments</a></h3>
<p>The script, as well as other UTXO metadata, such as the output features are signed for with the <a href="Glossary.html#sender-offset-keypair">sender offset</a> private 
key to prevent malleability. As we will describe later, the notion of a <a href="Glossary.html#script-offset">script offset</a> is introduced to prevent 
cut-through and forces the preservation of these commitments until they are recorded into the blockchain.</p>
<p>There are two changes to the protocol data structures that must be made to allow this scheme to work. </p>
<p>The first is a relatively minor adjustment to the transaction output definition.
The second is the inclusion of script input data and an additional public key in the transaction input field.</p>
<h3 id="transaction-output-changes"><a class="header" href="#transaction-output-changes">Transaction output changes</a></h3>
<p>The current definition of a Tari UTXO is:</p>

</code></pre>
<p><em>Note:</em> Currently, the output features are actually malleable. TariScript fixes this.</p>
<p>Under TariScript, this definition changes to accommodate the script and the <a href="Glossary.html#sender-offset-keypair">sender offset</a> public keys:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The commitment definition is unchanged:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
C_i = v_i \cdot H  + k_i \cdot G
\end{aligned}
\tag{1}
$$</p>
<p>The <a href="Glossary.html#metadata-signature">metadata signature</a> is an aggregated Commitment Signature signed with a combination of the homomorphic 
commitment private values \( (v_i \, , \, k_i )\), with the spending key only known by the receiver, and sender 
offset private key \(k_{Oi}\), only known by the sender. The signature challenge consists of all the transaction 
output metadata, effectively forming a contract between the sender and receiver, making all those values non-malleable 
and ensuring only the sender and receiver can enter into this contract. (See <a href="https://documents.uow.edu.au/%7Ewsusilo/ZCMS_IJNS08.pdf">Signature on Commitment values</a> by F. 
Zhang et. al. and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/061.pdf">Commitment Signature</a> by G. Yu. for details about this signature.)</p>
<p>Note that the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/061.pdf">Commitment Signature</a> is an aggregated signature between the sender and receiver, which is 
constructed as follows.</p>
<p>The sender portion of the public nonce is:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
R_{MSi} &amp;= r_{MSi_a} \cdot H + r_{MSi_b} \cdot G
\end{aligned}
\tag{2}
$$</p>
<p>The sender sends \(K_{Oi}, R_{MSi}\) to the receiver, who now has all the required information to calculate the final 
challenge. The receiver portion of the public nonce is:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
R_{MRi} &amp;= r_{MRi_a} \cdot H + r_{MRi_b} \cdot G
\end{aligned}
\tag{3}
$$</p>
<p>The final challenge is: </p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
e &amp;= \hash{ (R_{MSi} + R_{MRi}) \cat \script_i \cat F_i \cat K_{Oi} \cat C_i} \\
\end{aligned}
\tag{4}
$$</p>
<p>The receiver can now calculate their portion of the aggregated Commitment Signature as:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
R_{MRi} &amp;= r_{MRi_a} \cdot H + r_{MRi_b} \cdot G \\
a_{MRi} &amp;= r_{MRi_a} + e(v_{i}) \\
b_{MRi} &amp;= r_{MRi_b} + e(k_i)
\end{aligned}
\tag{5}
$$</p>
<p>The receiver sends \( s_{MRi} = (a_{MRi}, b_{MRi}, R_{MRi} ) \) along with the other partial transaction information to 
the sender. The sender starts by calculating the final challenge (16) and then completes their part of the aggregated 
Commitment Signature.</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{MSi} &amp;= r_{MSi_a} \\
b_{MSi} &amp;= r_{MSi_b} + e(k_{Oi})
\end{aligned}
\tag{6}
$$</p>
<p>Note that (6) is a slight deviation to the Commitment Signature due to the fact that we do not have a private value for 
\( a_{MSi} \). This is equivalent to having a commitment to the value of zero (i.e. 
\( C_i = 0 \cdot H  + k_{Oi} \cdot G \)). </p>
<p>The final aggregated Commitment Signature is combined a follows:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
s_{Mi} &amp;= (a_{Mi}, b_{Mi}, R_{Mi} ) \\
&amp;= ((a_{MSi} + a_{MRi}), (b_{MSi} + b_{MRi}), (R_{MSi} + R_{MRi}) )
\end{aligned}
\tag{7}
$$</p>
<p>This is verified by the following:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{Mi} \cdot H + b_{Mi} \cdot G = R_{Mi} + (C_i + K_{Oi})e
\end{aligned}
\tag{8}
$$</p>
<p>However, when evaluating (8) it is evident that the receiver can calculate \( r_{MSi_a} \) as follows:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{MSi} &amp;= a_{Mi} - a_{MRi} \\
r_{MSi_a} &amp;= a_{MSi}
\end{aligned}
\tag{9}
$$</p>
<p>To not leak any private nonces from the sender to the receiver, \( r_{MSi_a} \) can be set to zero, effectively 
turning the sender portion of the aggregated signature into a normal Schnorr signature. Therefore, (2), (6) and (7) can 
be rewritten as follows:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
R_{MSi} &amp;= r_{MSi_b} \cdot G
\end{aligned}
\tag{10}
$$</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{MSi} &amp;= 0 \\
b_{MSi} &amp;= r_{MSi_b} + e(k_{Oi})
\end{aligned}
\tag{11}
$$</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
s_{Mi} &amp;= (a_{Mi}, b_{Mi}, R_{Mi} ) \\
&amp;= (a_{MRi}, (b_{MSi} + b_{MRi}), (R_{MSi} + R_{MRi}) )
\end{aligned}
\tag{12}
$$</p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The UTXO has a positive value <code>v</code> like any normal UTXO.</li>
<li>The script and the output features can no longer be changed by the miner or any other party. This includes the sender 
and receiver; they would need to cooperate to enter into a new contract to change any metadata, otherwise the 
metadata signature will be invalidated.</li>
<li>We provide the complete script on the output.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="transaction-input-changes"><a class="header" href="#transaction-input-changes">Transaction input changes</a></h3>
<p>The current definition of an input is</p>

</code></pre>
<p>In standard Mimblewimble, an input is the same as an output <em>sans</em> range proof. The range proof doesn't need to be 
checked again when spending inputs, so it is dropped. </p>
<p>The updated input definition is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub struct TransactionInput {

<p>The <code>script_signature</code> is an aggregated Commitment Signature signed with a combination of the homomorphic commitment 
private values \( (v_i \, , \, k_i )\) and <a href="Glossary.html#script-keypair">script private key</a> \(k_{Si}\) to prove ownership thereof. It 
signs the script, the script input, <a href="Glossary.html#script-keypair">script public key</a> and the commitment:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
s_{Si} = (a_{Si}, b_{Si}, R_{Si} )

e &amp;= \hash{ R_{Si} \cat \alpha_i \cat \input_i \cat K_{Si} \cat C_i} \\
\end{aligned}

<p>This is verified by the following:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{Si} \cdot H + b_{Si} \cdot G = R_{Si} + (C_i+K_{Si})e
\end{aligned}
\tag{15}
$$</p>
<p>The script public key \(K_{Si}\) needed for the script signature verification is not stored with the TransactionInput, 
but obtained by executing the script with the provided input data. Because this signature is signed with the script 
private key \(k_{Si}\), it ensures that only the owner can provide the input data \(\input_i\) to the 
TransactionInput. </p>
<h3 id="script-offset"><a class="header" href="#script-offset">Script Offset</a></h3>
<p>For every transaction an accompanying <a href="Glossary.html#script-offset">script offset</a> \( \so \) needs to be provided. This is there to prove that every<br />
script public key \( K_{Sj} \) and every sender offset public key \( K_{Oi} \) supplied with the UTXOs are the 
correct ones. The sender will know and provide sender offset private keys \(k_{Oi} \) and script private keys 
\(k_{Si} \); these are combined to create the script offset \( \so \), which is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\so = \sum_j\mathrm{k_{Sj}} - \sum_i\mathrm{k_{Oi}} \; \text{for each input}, j,\, \text{and each output}, i
\end{aligned}
\tag{16}
$$</p>
<p>Verification of (16) will entail:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\so \cdot G = \sum_j\mathrm{K_{Sj}} - \sum_i\mathrm{K_{Oi}} \; \text{for each input}, j,\, \text{and each output}, i
\end{aligned}
\tag{17}
$$</p>
<p>We modify the transactions to be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub struct Transaction {
    
    ...
    
    /// A scalar offset that links outputs and inputs to prevent cut-through, enforcing the correct application of
    /// the output script.
    pub script_offset: BlindingFactor,
}
</code></pre>
<p>All script offsets (\(\so\)) from (16) contained in a block is summed together to create a total <a href="Glossary.html#script-offset">script offset</a> (18) 
so that algorithm (16) still holds for a block.</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\so_{total} = \sum_k\mathrm{\so_{k}}\; \text{for every transaction}, k
\end{aligned}
\tag{18}
$$</p>
<p>Verification of (18) will entail:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\so_{total} \cdot G = \sum_j\mathrm{K_{Sj}} - \sum_i\mathrm{K_{Oi}} \; \text{for each input}, j,\, \text{and each output}, i
\end{aligned}
\tag{19}
$$</p>
<p>As can be seen all information required to verify (18) is contained in a block's inputs and outputs. One important 
distinction to make is that the Coinbase output in a coinbase transaction does not count towards the script offset. 
This is because the Coinbase UTXO already has special rules accompanying it and it has no input, thus we cannot generate 
a script offset \( \so \). The coinbase output can allow any script \(\script_i\) and sender offset public key 
\( K_{Oi} \) as long as it does not break any of the rules in <a href="RFC-0120_Consensus.html">RFC 120</a> and the script is 
honored at spend. If the coinbase is used as in input, it is treated exactly the same as any other input.</p>
<p>We modify Blockheaders to be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub struct BlockHeader {
    
    ...
    
    /// Sum of script offsets for all kernels in this block.
    pub total_script_offset: BlindingFactor,
}
</code></pre>
<p>This notion of the script offset \(\so\) means that the no third party can remove any input or output from a 
transaction or the block, as that will invalidate the script offset balance equation, either (17) or (19) depending on 
whether the scope is a transaction or block. It is important to know that this also stops 
<a href="RFC-0201_TariScript.html#cut-through">cut‑through</a> so that we can verify all spent UTXO scripts. Because the script private key and<br />
sender offset private key is not publicly known, its impossible to create a new script offset.</p>
<p>Certain scripts may allow more than one valid set of input data. Users might be led to believe that this will allow a 
third party to change the script keypair \((k_{Si}\),\(K_{Si})\). If an attacker can change the \(K_{Si}\) 
keys of the input then he can take control of the \(K_{Oi}\) as well, allowing the attacker to change the metadata of 
the UTXO including the script. But as shown in <a href="RFC-0201_TariScript.html#script-offset-security">Script offset security</a>, this is not possible.</p>
<p>If equation (17) or (19) balances then we know that every included input and output in the transaction or block has its 
correct script public key and sender offset public key. Signatures (2) &amp; (13) are checked independently from script 
offset verification (17) and (19), and looked at in isolation those could verify correctly but can still be signed by 
fake keys. When doing verification in (17) and (19) you know that the signatures and the message/metadata signed by the 
private keys can be trusted.</p>
<h3 id="consensus-changes"><a class="header" href="#consensus-changes">Consensus changes</a></h3>
<p>The Mimblewimble balance for blocks and transactions stays the same.</p>

<ol>
<li>The <a href="Glossary.html#metadata-signature">metadata signature</a> \( s_{Mi} \) is valid for every output.</li>

</ol>
<h2 id="examples"><a class="header" href="#examples">Examples</a></h2>
<p>Let's cover a few examples to illustrate the new scheme and provide justification for the additional requirements and
validation steps.</p>
<h3 id="standard-mw-transaction"><a class="header" href="#standard-mw-transaction">Standard MW transaction</a></h3>
<p>For this use case we have Alice who sends Bob some Tari.
Bob's wallet is  online and is able to countersign the transaction.</p>
<p>Alice creates a new transaction spending \( C_a \) to a new output containing the commitment \( C_b \) (ignoring 
fees for now).</p>
<p>To spend \( C_a \), she provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>An input that contains \( C_a \).</li>
<li>The script input, \( \input_a \).</li>
<li>A valid script signature, \( s_{Si} \) as per (13),(14) proving that she owns the commitment 
\( C_a \), knows the private key, \( k_{Sa} \), corresponding to \( K_{Sa} \), the public key left on the stack 
after executing \( \script_a \) with \( \input_a \).</li>
<li>A sender offset public key, \( K_{Ob} \).</li>
<li>The sender portion of the public nonce, \( R_{MSi} )\, as per (10).</li>
<li>The script offset, \( \so\) with:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\so  = k_{Sa} - k_{Ob}
\end{aligned}
\tag{20}
$$</li>
</ul>
<p>Alice sends the usual first round data to Bob, but now because of TariScript also includes \( K_{Ob} \) and 
\( R_{MSi} \). Bob can then complete his side of the transaction as per the <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/mimblewimble-1/MainReport.html">standard Mimblewimble protocol</a> 
providing the commitment \(C_b\), its public blinding factor, its rangeproof and the partial transaction signature.
In addition, Bob also needs to provide a partial metadata signature as per (5) where he commits to all the transaction 
output metadata with a commitment signature. Because Alice is creating the transaction, she can suggest the script 
\( \script_b \) to use for Bob's output, similar to a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction">bitcoin transaction</a>, but Bob can choose a different script 
\(\script_b\). However, in most cases the parties will agree on using something akin to a <code>NOP</code> script 
\(\script_b\). Bob has to return this consistent set of information back to Alice.</p>
<p>Alice verifies the information received back from Bob, check if she agrees with the script \( \script_b \) Bob signed, 
and calculates her portion of the <a href="Glossary.html#metadata-signature">metadata signature</a> \( s_{Mb} \) with: </p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
s_{Mb} = r_{mb} + k_{Ob} \hash{ \script_b \cat F_b \cat R_{Mb} }
\end{aligned}
\tag{21}
$$</p>
<p>Alice then constructs the final aggregated metadata signature \(s_{Mb}\) as per (12) and replaces Bob's partial 
metadata signature in Bob's TransactionOutput.</p>
<p>She completes the transaction as per <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/mimblewimble-1/MainReport.html">standard Mimblewimble protocol</a> and also adds the script offset \( \so \), after 
which she sends the final transaction to Bob and broadcasts it to the network.</p>
<h4 id="transaction-validation"><a class="header" href="#transaction-validation">Transaction validation</a></h4>
<p>Base nodes validate the transaction as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>They check that the usual Mimblewimble balance holds by summing inputs and outputs and validating against the excess
signature. This check does not change nor do the other validation rules, such as confirming that all inputs are in
the UTXO set etc.</li>
<li>The metadata signature \(s_{Ma}\) on Bob's output,</li>
<li>The input script must execute successfully using the provided input data; and the script result must be a valid 
public key,</li>
<li>The script signature on Alice's input is valid by checking:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{Sa} \cdot H + b_{Sa} \cdot G = R_{Sa} + (C_a + K_{Sa})* \hash{ R_{Sa} \cat \alpha_a \cat \input_a \cat K_{Sa} \cat C_a}
\end{aligned}
\tag{22}
$$</p>
<ul>
<li>The script offset is verified by checking that the balance holds:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\so \cdot{G} = K_{Sa} - K_{Ob}
\end{aligned}
\tag{23}
$$</p>
<p>Finally, when Bob spends this output, he will use \( K_{Sb} \) as his script input and sign it with his script 
private key \( k_{Sb} \). He will choose a new sender offset public key \( K_{Oc} \) to give to the recipient, and 
he will construct the script offset, \( \so_b \) as follows:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\so_b = k_{Sb} - k_{Oc}
\end{aligned}
\tag{24}
$$</p>
<h3 id="one-sided-payment"><a class="header" href="#one-sided-payment">One sided payment</a></h3>
<p>In this example, Alice pays Bob, who is not available to countersign the transaction, so Alice initiates a one-sided 
payment,</p>
<p>$$
C_a \Rightarrow  C_b
$$</p>
<p>Once again, transaction fees are ignored to simplify the illustration.</p>
<p>Alice owns \( C_a \) and provides the required script to spend the UTXO as was described in the previous cases.</p>
<p>Alice needs a public key from Bob, \( K_{Sb} \) to complete the one-sided transaction. This key can be obtained
out-of-band, and might typically be Bob's wallet public key on the Tari network.</p>
<p>Bob requires the value \( v_b \) and blinding factor \( k_b \) to claim his payment, but he needs to be able to 
claim it without asking Alice for them.</p>
<p>This information can be obtained by using Diffie-Hellman and Bulletproof rewinding. If the blinding factor \( k_b \) 
was calculated with Diffie-Hellman using the sender offset keypair, (\( k_{Ob} \),\( K_{Ob} \)) as the sender 
keypair and the script keypair, \( (k_{Sb} \),\( K_{Sb}) \) as the receiver keypair, the blinding factor 
\( k_b \) can be securely calculated without communication.</p>
<p>Alice uses Bob's public key to create a shared secret, \( k_b \) for the output commitment, \( C_b \), using
Diffie-Hellman key exchange.</p>
<p>Alice calculates \( k_b \) as</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
k_b = k_{Ob} * K_{Sb}
\end{aligned}
\tag{25}
$$</p>
<p>Next Alice uses Bulletproof rewinding, see <a href="RFC-0180_BulletproofRewinding.html">RFC 180</a>, to encrypt the value 
\( v_b \) into the the Bulletproof for the commitment \( C_b \). For this she uses 
\( k_{rewind} =  \hash{k_{b}} \) as the rewind_key and \( k_{blinding} =  \hash{\hash{k_{b}}} \) as the blinding 
key.</p>
<p>Alice knows the script-redeeming private key \( k_{Sa}\) for the transaction input.</p>
<p>Alice will create the entire transaction, including generating a new sender offset keypair and calculating the 
script offset,</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\so = k_{Sa} - k_{Ob}
\end{aligned}
\tag{26}
$$</p>
<p>She also provides a script that locks the output to Bob's public key, <code>PushPubkey(K_Sb)</code>.
This will only be spendable if the spender can provide a valid signature as input that demonstrates proof
of knowledge of \( k_{Sb}\) as well as the value and blinding factor of the output \(C_b\). Although Alice knowns 
the value and blinding factor of the output \(C_b\) only Bob knows \( k_{Sb}\).</p>
<p>Any base node can now verify that the transaction is complete, verify the signature on the script, and verify the 
script offset.</p>
<p>For Bob to claim his commitment he will scan the blockchain for a known script because he knowns that the script will 
be <code>PushPubkey(K_Sb)</code>. In this case, the script is analogous to an address in Bitcoin or Monero. Bob's wallet can scan 
the blockchain looking for scripts that he would know how to resolve.</p>
<p>When Bob's wallet spots a known script, he requires the blinding factor, \( k_b \) and the value \( v_b \). First he 
uses Diffie-Hellman to calculate \( k_b \). </p>
<p>Bob calculates \( k_b \) as</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
k_b = K_{Ob} * k_{Sb}
\end{aligned}
\tag{27}
$$</p>
<p>Next Bob's wallet calculates \( k_{rewind} \), using \( k_{rewind} = \hash{k_{b}}\) and 
(\( k_{blinding} = \hash{\hash{k_{b}}} \), using those to rewind the Bulletproof to get the value \( v_b \). </p>
<p>Because Bob's wallet already knowns the script private key \( k_{Sb} \), he now knows all the values required to 
spend the commitment \( C_b \)</p>
<p>For Bob's part, when he discovers one-sided payments to himself, he should spend them to new outputs using a traditional
transaction to thwart any potential horizon attacks in the future.</p>
<p>To summarise, the information required for one-sided transactions are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="htlc-like-script"><a class="header" href="#htlc-like-script">HTLC-like script</a></h3>
<p>In this use case we have a script that controls where it can be spent. The script is out of scope for this example, but
has the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice can spend the UTXO unilaterally after block <em>n</em>, <strong>or</strong></li>
<li>Alice and Bob can spend it together.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would be typically what a lightning-type channel requires.</p>
<p>Alice owns the commitment \( C_a \). She and Bob work together to create \( C_s\). But we don't yet know who can 
spend the newly created \( C_s\) and under what conditions this will be.</p>
<p>$$
C_a \Rightarrow  C_s \Rightarrow  C_x
$$</p>
<p>Alice owns \( C_a\), so she knows the blinding factor \( k_a\) and the correct input for the script's spending 
conditions. Alice also generates the sender offset keypair, \( (k_{Os}, K_{Os} )\).</p>
<p>Now Alice and Bob proceed with the standard transaction flow.</p>
<p>Alice ensures that the sender offset public key \( K_{Os}\) is part of the output metadata that contains commitment 
\( C_s\). Alice will fill in the script with her \( k_{Sa}\) to unlock the commitment \( C_a\). Because Alice 
owns \( C_a\) she needs to construct \( \so\) with:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\so = k_{Sa} - k_{Os}
\end{aligned}
\tag{28}
$$</p>
<p>The blinding factor, \( k_s\) can be generated using a Diffie-Hellman construction. The commitment \( C_s\) needs to 
be constructed with the script that Bob agrees on. Until it is mined, Alice could modify the script via double-spend and 
thus Bob must wait until the transaction is confirmed before accepting the conditions of the smart contract between 
Alice and himself.</p>
<p>Once the UTXO is mined, both Alice and Bob possess all the knowledge required to spend the \( C_s \) UTXO. It's only
the conditions of the script that will discriminate between the two.</p>
<p>The spending case of either Alice or Bob claiming the commitment \( C_s\) follows the same flow described in the 
previous examples, with the sender proving knowledge of \( k_{Ss}\) and &quot;unlocking&quot; the spending script.</p>
<p>The case of Alice and Bob spending \( C_s \) together to a new multiparty commitment requires some elaboration.</p>
<p>Assume that Alice and Bob want to spend  \( C_s \) co-operatively. This involves the script being executed in such a 
way that the resulting public key on the stack is the sum of Alice and Bob's individual script keys, \( k_{SsA} \) and 
\( k_{SaB} \).</p>
<p>The script input needs to be signed by this aggregate key, and so Alice and Bob must each supply a partial signature 
following the usual Schnorr aggregate mechanics, but one person needs to add in the signature of the blinding factor and 
value.</p>
<p>In an analogous fashion, Alice and Bob also generate an aggregate sender offset private key \( k_{Ox}\), each using
their own \( k_{OxA} \) and \( k_{OxB}\).</p>
<p>To be specific, Alice calculates her portion from</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\so_A = k_{SsA} - k_{OxA}
\end{aligned}
\tag{29}
$$</p>
<p>Bob will construct his part of the \( \so\) with:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\so_B = k_{SsB} - k_{OxB}
\end{aligned}
\tag{30}
$$</p>
<p>And the aggregate \( \so\) is then:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\so = \so_A + \so_B
\end{aligned}
\tag{31}
$$</p>
<p>Notice that in this case, both \( K_{Ss} \) and \( K_{Ox}\) are aggregate keys.</p>
<p>Notice also that because the script resolves to an aggregate key \( K_s\) neither Alice nor Bob can claim the 
commitment \( C_s\) without the other party's key. If either party tries to cheat by editing the input, the script 
validation will fail.</p>
<p>If either party tries to cheat by creating a new output, the script offset will not validate correctly as it locks 
the output of the transaction.</p>
<p>A base node validating the transaction will also not be able to tell this is an aggregate transaction as all keys are 
aggregated Schnorr signatures. But it will be able to validate that the script input is correctly signed, thus the 
output public key is correct and that the \( \so\) is correctly calculated, meaning that the commitment \( C_x\) is 
the correct UTXO for the transaction.</p>
<p>To summarise, the information required for creating a multiparty UTXO is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="cut-through"><a class="header" href="#cut-through">Cut-through</a></h3>
<p>A major issue with many Mimblewimble extension schemes is that miners are able to cut-through UTXOs if an output is 
spent in the same block it was created. This makes it so that the intervening UTXO never existed; along with any checks 
and balances carried in that UTXO. It's also impossible to prove without additional information that cut-through even 
occurred (though one may suspect, since the &quot;one&quot; transaction would contribute two kernels to the block).</p>
<p>In particular, cut-through is devastating for an idea like TariScript which relies on conditions present in the UTXO 
being enforced.</p>
<p>This is a reason for the presence of the script offset in the TariScript proposal. It mathematically links all inputs 
and outputs of all the transactions in a block and that tallied up to create the script offset. Providing the script 
offset requires knowledge of keys that miners do not possess; thus they are unable to produce the necessary script 
offset when attempting to perform cut-through on a pair of transactions.</p>
<p>Lets show by example how the script offset stops cut-through, where Alice spends to Bob who spends to Carol. Ignoring 
fees, we have: </p>
<p>$$
C_a \Rightarrow  C_b \Rightarrow  C_c
$$</p>
<p>For these two transactions, the total script offset is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\so_1 = k_{Sa} - k_{Ob}\\
\so_2 = k_{Sb} - k_{Oc}\\
\end{aligned}
\tag{32}
$$</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\so_t = \so_1 + \so_2 =  (k_{Sa} + k_{Sb}) - (k_{Ob} + k_{Oc})\\
\end{aligned}
\tag{33}
$$</p>
<p>In standard Mimblewimble <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/grin-protocol-overview/MainReport.html#cut-through">cut-through</a> can be applied to get:</p>
<p>$$
C_a \Rightarrow  C_c
$$</p>
<p>After cut-through the total script offset becomes: </p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\so'_t = k_{Sa} - k_{Oc}\\
\end{aligned}
\tag{34}
$$</p>
<p>As we can see:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\so_t\ \neq \so'_t \\
\end{aligned}
\tag{35}
$$</p>
<p>A third party cannot generate a new script offset as only the original owner can provide the script private key \(k_{Sa}\) 
to create a new script offset. </p>
<h3 id="script-offset-security"><a class="header" href="#script-offset-security">Script offset security</a></h3>
<p>If all the inputs in a transaction or a block contain scripts such as just <code>NOP</code> or <code>CompareHeight</code> commands, then the 
hypothesis is that it is possible to recreate a false script offset. Lets show by example why this is not possible. In 
this Example we have Alice who pays Bob with no change output:</p>
<p>$$
C_a \Rightarrow  C_b
$$</p>
<p>Alice has an output \(C_{a}\) which contains a script that only has a <code>NOP</code> command in it. This means that the 
script \( \script_a \) will immediately exit on execution leaving the entire input data \( \input_a \)on the 
stack. She sends all the required information to Bob as per the <a href="RFC-0201_TariScript.html#standard-mw-transaction">standard mw transaction</a>, who 
creates an output \(C_{b}\). Because of the <code>NOP</code> script \( \script_a \), Bob can change the script public key 
\( K_{Sa}\) contained in the input data. Bob can now use his own \(k'_{Sa}\) as the script private key. He 
replaces the sender offset public key with his own \(K'_{Ob}\) allowing him to change the script 
\( \script_b \) and generate a new signature as in (2). Bob can now generate a new script offset with 
\(\so' = k'_{Sa} - k'_{Ob} \). Up to this point, it all seems valid. No one can detect that Bob changed the script 
to \( \script_b \).</p>
<p>But what Bob also needs to do is generate the signature in (13). For this signature Bob needs to know 
\(k_{Sa}, k_a, v_a\). Because Bob created a fake script private key, and there is no change in this transaction, 
he does know the script private key and the value. But Bob does not know the blinding factor \(k_a\) of Alice's 
commitment and thus cannot complete the signature in (13). Only the rightful owner of the commitment, which in 
Mimblewimble terms is the  person who knows \( k_a, v_a\), can generate the signature in (13).</p>
<h3 id="script-lock-key-generation"><a class="header" href="#script-lock-key-generation">Script lock key generation</a></h3>
<p>At face value, it looks like the burden for wallets has tripled, since each UTXO owner has to remember three private 
keys, the spend key, \( k_i \), the sender offset key \( k_{O} \) and the script key \( k_{S} \). In practice, the 
script key will often be a static key associated with the user's node or wallet. Even if it is not, the script and 
sender offset keys can be deterministically derived from the spend key. For example, \( k_{S} \) could be 
\( \hash{ k_i \cat \alpha} \).</p>
<h3 id="blockchain-bloat"><a class="header" href="#blockchain-bloat">Blockchain bloat</a></h3>
<p>The most obvious drawback to TariScript is the effect it will have on blockchain size. UTXOs are substantially larger,
with the addition of the script, script signature, and a public key to every output.</p>
<p>These can eventually be pruned, but will increase storage and bandwidth requirements.</p>
<p>Input size of a block will now be much bigger as each input was previously just a commitment and output features.
Each input now includes a script, input_data, the script signature and an extra public key. This could be compacted by
just broadcasting input hashes along with the missing script input data and signature, instead of the full input in
transaction messages, but this will still be larger than inputs are currently.</p>
<p>Every header will also be bigger as it includes an extra blinding factor that will not be pruned away.</p>
<h3 id="fodder-for-chain-analysis"><a class="header" href="#fodder-for-chain-analysis">Fodder for chain analysis</a></h3>
<p>Another potential drawback of TariScript is the additional information that is handed to entities wishing to perform 
chain analysis. Having scripts attached to outputs will often clearly mark the purpose of that UTXO. Users may wish to 
re-spend outputs into vanilla, default UTXOs in a mixing transaction to disassociate Tari funds from a particular 
script.</p>
<h2 id="notation"><a class="header" href="#notation">Notation</a></h2>
<p>Where possible, the &quot;usual&quot; notation is used to denote terms commonly found in cryptocurrency literature. Lower case 
characters are used as private keys, while uppercase characters are used as public keys. New terms introduced by 
TariScript are assigned greek lowercase letters in most cases. The capital letter subscripts, <em>R</em> and <em>S</em> refer to a 
UTXO <em>receiver</em> and <em>script</em> respectively.</p>

<p>TariScript places restrictions on <em>who</em> can spend UTXOs. It will also be useful for Tari digital asset applications to
restrict <em>how</em> or <em>where</em> UTXOs may be spent in some cases. The general term for these sorts of restrictions are termed
<em>covenants</em>. The <a href="https://handshake.org/files/handshake.txt">Handshake white paper</a> has a fairly good description of how covenants work.</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this RFC, but it's anticipated that TariScript would play a key role in the introduction of
generalised covenant support into Tari.</p>

validation.</p>

<p>The proposal for TariScript is straightforward. It is based on Bitcoin script and inherits most of its ideas.</p>
<p>The main properties of <a href="Glossary.html#tariscript">TariScript</a> are</p>
<ul>
<li>The scripting language is stack-based. At redeem time, the UTXO spender must supply an input stack. The script runs by
operating on the stack contents.</li>
<li>If an error occurs during execution, the script fails.</li>
<li>After the script completes, it is successful if and only if it has not aborted, and there is exactly a single element
on the stack. The script fails if the stack is empty, or contains more than one element, or aborts early.</li>
<li>It is not Turing complete, so there are no loops or timing functions.</li>
<li>The opcodes enforce type safety. e.g. A public key cannot be added to an integer scalar. Errors of this kind MUST cause
the script to fail. The Rust implementation of <a href="Glossary.html#tariscript">TariScript</a> automatically applies the type safety rules.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="failure-modes"><a class="header" href="#failure-modes">Failure modes</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin transactions can &quot;fail&quot; in two main ways: Either there is a genuine error in the locking or unlocking script;
or a wallet broadcasts a <em><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2019.00007/full">Non-standard transaction</a></em> to a non-mining node. To be more precise, Bitcoin core nodes
only accept a small subset of valid transaction scripts that are deemed <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin/9781491902639/ch05.html">Standard transactions</a>. To succesfully produce
a non-standard Bitcoin transaction, one has to submit it directly to a miner that accepts non-standard transactions.</p>
<p>It's interesting to note that only 0.02% of transactions
mined in Bitcoin before block 550,000 were non-standard, and it appears that the vast majority of these were in fact
unintentional, leading to loss of funds <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2019.00007/full">(1)</a>.</p>
<p>The present RFC proposes that TariScript not identify a subset of transactions as &quot;standard&quot;. However, some transactions
might be invalid in and of- themselves (e.g. invalid signature, invalid script), while others may be invalid because of
the execution context (e.g. a lock time has not expired).</p>
<p>All Tari nodes MUST reject the former type of invalid transaction; and SHOULD reject the latter. In these instances, it
is the <em>wallets'</em> responsibility to wait until transactions are valid before broadcasting them.</p>
<p>Rejected transactions are simply silently dropped.</p>
<p>This policy discourages spamming on the network and promotes responsible behaviour by wallets.</p>

<h2 id="serialisation-1"><a class="header" href="#serialisation-1">Serialisation</a></h2>
<p>TariScript and the execution stack are serialised into byte strings using a simple linear parser. Since all opcodes are
a single byte, it's very easy to read and write script byte strings. If an opcode has a parameter associated with it,
e.g. <code>PushHash</code> then it is equally known how many bytes following the opcode will contain the parameter.</p>
<p>The script input data is serialised in an analogous manner. The first byte in a stream indicates the type of data in the
bytes that follow. The length of each type is fixed and known <em>a priori</em>. The next <em>n</em> bytes read represent the data type.</p>
<p>As input data elements are read in, they are pushed onto the stack. This means that the <em>last</em> input element will typically
be operated on <em>first</em>!</p>
<p>The types of input parameters that are accepted are:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Type</th><th align="left">Range / Value</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Integer</td><td align="left">64-bit signed integer</td></tr>

<h3 id="anyone-can-spend"><a class="header" href="#anyone-can-spend">Anyone can spend</a></h3>
<p>The simplest script is an empty script, or a script with a single <code>NoOp</code> opcode. When faced with this script, the spender
can supply any pubkey in her script input for which she knows the private key. The script will execute, leaving that
public key as the result, and the transaction script validation will pass.</p>
<h3 id="one-sided-transactions"><a class="header" href="#one-sided-transactions">One-sided transactions</a></h3>
<p>One-sided transactions lock the input to a predetermined public key provided by the recipient; essentially the same
method that Bitcoin uses. The simplest form of this is to simply post the new owner's public key as the script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">PushPubkey(P_B)
</code></pre>
<p>To spend this output, Bob provides an empty input stack. After execution, the stack contains his public key.</p>
<p>An equivalent script to Bitcoin's P2PKH would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Dup HashBlake256 PushHash(PKH) EqualVerify
</code></pre>
<p>To spend this, Bob provides his public key as script input.
To illustrate the execution process, we show the script running on the left, and resulting stack on the right:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Initial script</th><th align="left">Initial Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<table><thead><tr><th align="left"><code>EqualVerify</code></th><th align="left"></th></tr></thead><tbody>

<p>The script has completed without errors, and Bob's public key remains on the stack.</p>
<h3 id="time-locked-contract"><a class="header" href="#time-locked-contract">Time-locked contract</a></h3>
<p>Alice sends some Tari to Bob. If he doesn't spend it within a certain timeframe (up till block 4000), then she is also
able to spend it back to herself.</p>
<p>The spender provides their public key as input to the script.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Dup PushPubkey(P_b) CheckHeight(4000) GeZero IFTHEN PushPubkey(P_a) OrVerify(2) ELSE EqualVerify ENDIF
</code></pre>
<p>Let's run through this script assuming it's block 3990 and Bob is spending the UTXO. We'll only print the stack this
time:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Initial Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>Dup</code>:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<p><code>PushPubkey(P_b)</code>:</p>

<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>CheckHeight(4000)</code>. The block height is 3990, so <code>3990 - 4000</code> is pushed to the stack:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">-10</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>GeZero</code> pushes a 1 if the top stack element is positive or zero:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">0</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>IFTHEN</code> compares the top of the stack to 1. It is not a match, so it will execute the <code>ELSE</code> branch:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>EqualVerify</code> checks that <code>P_b</code> is equal to Bob's pubkey:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The <code>ENDIF</code> is a no-op, so the stack contains Bob's public key, meaning Bob must sign to spend this transaction.</p>
<p>Similarly, if it is after block 4000, say block 4005, and Alice or Bob tries to spend the UTXO, the sequence is:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Initial Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>Dup</code> and <code>PushPubkey(P_b)</code> as before:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>CheckHeight(4000)</code> calculates <code>4005 - 4000)</code> and pushes 5 to the stack:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">5</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>GeZero</code> pops the 5 and pushes a 1 to the stack:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">1</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The top of the stack is 1, so <code>IFTHEN</code> executes the first branch, <code>PushPubkey(P_a)</code>:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_a</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>OrVerify(2)</code> compares the 3rd element, Alice's pubkey, with the 2 top items that were popped. There is a match, so the script
continues.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>If the script executes successfully, then either Alice's or Bob's public key is left on the stack, meaning only Alice
or Bob can spend the output.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-4"><a class="header" href="#introduction-4">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Tari protocol extends the <a href="./Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a> protocol to include scripting in the form of <a href="./Glossary.html#tariscript">TariScript</a>. One of the 
first features implemented using <a href="./Glossary.html#tariscript">TariScript</a> was <a href="./RFC-0201_TariScript.html#one-sided-payment">one-sided payments</a>. These are payments to a recipient that do not 
require an interactive negotiation in the same way a standard <a href="./Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a> transaction does. One of the main downsides
of the current implementation of <a href="./RFC-0201_TariScript.html#one-sided-payment">one-sided payments</a> is that the script key used is the Public Key of the recipient's 
wallet. This public key is embedded in the <a href="./Glossary.html#tariscript">TariScript</a> of the <a href="./Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a> created by the sender. The issue is that it becomes
very easy for a third party to scan the blockchain to look for one-sided transaction outputs being sent to a given wallet. 
In order to alleviate this privacy leak, this RFC proposes the use of Dual-Key Stealth Addresses to be used as the script
key when sending a one-sided payment.</p>
<h2 id="brief-background-on-the-development-of-stealth-addresses"><a class="header" href="#brief-background-on-the-development-of-stealth-addresses">Brief background on the development of Stealth Addresses</a></h2>
<p>Stealth addresses were first proposed on the Bitcoin Talk forum by user <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5965.0">Bytecoin</a>. The concept was further refined in 
the <a href="https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf">Cryptonote</a> whitepaper and by <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg03613.html">Peter Todd</a> which went on to be used in Monero. These formulations were very similar 
to the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032">BIP-32</a> style of address generation. Later in 2014 a developer called rynomster/sdcoin proposed a further 
improvement to the scheme that he called the Dual-Key Stealth Address Protocol (DKSAP) that allowed for a separate 
scanning key and spending key. Since then there have been many variations of DKSAP proposed, but generally they only 
offer performance optimizations for certain scenarios or add an application-specific feature. For our application, DKSAP 
will do the job.</p>
<h2 id="dual-key-stealth-addresses"><a class="header" href="#dual-key-stealth-addresses">Dual-key Stealth Addresses</a></h2>
<p>The Dual-key Stealth Address Protocol (DKSAP) uses two key-pairs for the recipient of a <a href="./RFC-0201_TariScript.html#one-sided-payment">one-sided payment</a>, 
\( A = a \cdot G \) and \( B = b \cdot G \). Where \( a \) is called the scan key and \( b \) is the spend key.
A recipient will distribute the public keys out of band to receive <a href="./RFC-0201_TariScript.html#one-sided-payment">one-sided payments</a>.</p>
<p>The protocol that a sender will use to make a payment to the recipient is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sender generates a random nonce key-pair \( R = r \cdot G \).</li>
<li>Sender calculates a ECDH shared secret \(c = H( r \cdot a \cdot G ) = H( a \cdot R) = H( r \cdot A) \), where
\( H( \cdot ) \) is a cryptographic hash function.</li>
<li>The sender will then use \( K_S = c \cdot G + B \) as the last public key in the <a href="./RFC-0201_TariScript.html#one-sided-payment">one-sided payment</a> script. </li>
<li>The sender includes  \( R \) for the receiver but dropping it as it is not required during script execution. 
This changes the script for a <a href="./RFC-0201_TariScript.html#one-sided-payment">one-sided payment</a> from <code>PushPubkey(K_S)</code> to <code>PushPubkey(R) Drop PushPubkey(K_S)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The recipient will need to scan the blockchain for outputs that contain scripts of the <a href="./RFC-0201_TariScript.html#one-sided-payment">one-sided payment</a> form, and when
one is found they will need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extract the nonce \( R \) from the script.</li>
<li>Use the public nonce to calculate the shared secret \(c = H( a \cdot R) \)</li>
<li>Calculate \( K_S \) and check if it exists in the script.</li>
<li>If it exists, the recipient can produce the script signature required using the private key calculated by \( c + b \). 
This private key can only be computed by the recipient using \( b \).</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the benefits of the DKSAP is that the key used for scanning the blockchain, \( a \), does not enable one to
calculate the private key required for spending the output. This means that a recipient can potentially outsource the
scanning of the blockchain to a less trusted third-party by giving them just the scanning key \( a \) but retaining the
secrecy of the spend key \( b \).</p>

<h4 id="time-locked-utxos"><a class="header" href="#time-locked-utxos">Time-locked UTXOs</a></h4>
<p>Time-locked Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) can be accomplished by adding a feature flag to a UTXO and a lock height, 
also referred to as the output's maturity. This allows a consensus limit on after which height the output can be 
spent.</p>
<p>This requires that users constructing a transaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST include a feature flag of their UTXO; and</li>
<li>MUST include a lock height in their UTXO.</li>
</ul>
<p>This adds the following requirement for a <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">base node</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">base node</a> MUST NOT allow a UTXO to be spent if the <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a> has not already exceeded the UTXO's lock height.</li>
</ul>
<p>This also adds the following requirement for a <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">base node</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A base node MUST reject any <a href="Glossary.html#block">block</a> that contains a <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a> with a lock height not already past the <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="time-locked-contracts"><a class="header" href="#time-locked-contracts">Time-locked Contracts</a></h4>
<p>In standard <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a>, time-locked contracts can be accomplished by modifying the kernel of each transaction to 
include a lock height. This limits how early in the blockchain lifetime the specific transaction can be included in a 
block. This approach is used in a traditional <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a> construction that does not implement any kind of scripting.
This has two disadvantages. Firstly, the spending condition is very primitive and cannot be linked to other conditions.
Secondly, it bloats the kernel, which is a component of the transaction that cannot be pruned.</p>
<p>However, with <a href="RFC-0201_TariScript.html">TariScript</a> it becomes possible to express spending conditions like a time-lock as part of a UTXO's script.
The <code>CheckHeightVerify(height)</code> TariScript Op code allows a time-lock check to be incorporated into a script. The following is a simple
example of a plain time-lock script that prevents an output from being spent before the chain reaches height 4000:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">CheckHeightVerify(4000)
</code></pre>
<h4 id="hashed-time-locked-contract"><a class="header" href="#hashed-time-locked-contract">Hashed Time-locked Contract</a></h4>
<p>Hashed time-locked contracts (<a href="Glossary.html#hashed-time-locked-contract">HTLC</a>) are a way of reserving funds that can only be spent if a hash pre-image can be provided or
if a specified amount of time has passed. The hash pre-image is a secret that can be revealed under the right conditions
to enable spending of the UTXO before the time-lock is reached. The secret can be directly exchanged between the parties or
revealed to the other party by spending an output that makes use of an adaptor signature.</p>
<p><a href="Glossary.html#hashed-time-locked-contract">HTLC</a>s enable a number of interesting transaction constructions. For example, <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/atomic-swaps/AtomicSwaps.html">Atomic Swaps</a>
and Payment Channels like those in the <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/lightning-network-for-dummies">Lightning Network</a>.</p>
<p>The following is an example of an <a href="Glossary.html#hashed-time-locked-contract">HTLC</a> script. In this script, Alice sends some Tari to Bob that he can spend using the 
private key of <code>P_b</code> if he can provide the pre-image to the SHA256 hash output (<code>HASH256{pre_image}</code>) specified in the script
by Alice. If Bob has not spent this UTXO before the chain reaches height 5000 then Alice will be able to spend the output
using the private key of <code>P_a</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">HashSha256
PushHash(HASH256{pre_image})
Equal
IFTHEN
   PushPubkey(P_b)
ELSE
   CheckHeightVerify(5000)
   PushPubkey(P_a)
ENDIF

<h2 id="description-16"><a class="header" href="#description-16">Description</a></h2>
<p>Atomic swaps are atomic transactions that allow users to exchange different crypto assets and or coins without using a
central exchange and or trusting each other. Trading coins or assets this way makes it much more private and secure to
do and swap because no third party is required to be secure. Atomic swaps work on the principle of using 
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hash_Time_Locked_Contracts">Hashed Time Lock Contracts</a>(HTLC). 
In short, it requires some hash pre-image to unlock the contract, or the time-lock can be used to reclaim the funds. </p>
<p>In a cross-chain Atomic swap, both users lock up the funds to be exchanged on their respective chains in an HTLC-type contract. 
However, the two contracts’ pre-image, or spending secret, is the same, but only one party knows the correct pre-image. 
When the first HTLC contract is spent, this publicly reveals the pre-image for the other party to spend the second HTLC.
If the first HTLC is never spent, the second transaction's time-lock will allow the user to respend the funds back to
themselves after the time lock has passed.</p>
<h3 id="btc---xtr-atomicswap"><a class="header" href="#btc---xtr-atomicswap">BTC - XTR AtomicSwap</a></h3>
<h4 id="overview-2"><a class="header" href="#overview-2">Overview</a></h4>
<p>BTC uses a scripting language for smart contracts on transactions which enables <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/atomic-swaps/AtomicSwaps.html">atomic swaps</a>
on the BTC chain. Traditionally <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a> coins do not implement scripts, which makes Atomic swaps harder to
implement but not impossible. Grin has implemented atomic swaps using a version of a 2-of-2 multi-signature transaction
<a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/grin-protocol-overview/MainReport.html#atomic-swaps">mimblewimble atomic swaps</a>.
Fortunately, Tari does have scripting with <a href="Glossary.html#tariscript">TariScript</a>, which works a lot like BTC scripts, making the implementation simpler.
Because of the scripting similarities, the scripts to both HTLCs will look very similar, and we only need to ensure that
we use the same hash function in both. </p>
<p>To do an Atomic swap from BTC to XTR, we need four wallets, two BTC wallets, and two XTR wallets, one wallet per person,
per coin.</p>
<p>As an example, Alice wants to trade some of her XTR for Bob's BTC. Alice and Bob need to agree on an amount of XTR and
BTC to swap. Once an agreement is reached, the swap is executed in the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alice chooses a set of random bytes, \( \preimage \), as the pre-image and hashes it with SHA256. She then sends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the hash of the pre-image, \( \hash{\preimage} \), to Bob along with her BTC address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bob sends her a public version of his <a href="Glossary.html#script-keypair">script key</a>, \( K_{Sb} \), for use in the XTR transaction, which we can refer
to as Bob's script address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alice creates a one-sided XTR transaction with an HTLC contract requiring \( \preimage \) as the input, which will
either payout to Bob's script address or her script address, \( K_{Sa} \), after a particular &quot;time&quot; has elapsed
(block height has been reached). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bob waits for this transaction to be mined. When it is mined, he verifies that the UTXO spending script expects a
comparison of \( \hash{\preimage} \) as the first instruction, and that his public <a href="Glossary.html#script-keypair">script key</a>, \( K_{Sb} \), will
be the final value remaining after executing the script. He has the private <a href="Glossary.html#script-keypair">script key</a>, \( k_{Sb} \), to enable him
to produce a signature to claim the funds if he can get hold of the expected pre-image input value, \( \preimage \).
He also verifies that the UTXO has a sufficiently long time-lock to give him time to claim the transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon verification, Bob creates a Segwit HTLC BTC transaction with the same \( \hash{\preimage} \), which will spend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to Alice's BTC address she gave him. It is essential to note that the time lock for this HTLC has to expire before</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the time lock of the XTR HTLC that Alice created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alice checks the Bitcoin blockchain, and upon seeing that the transaction is mined, she claims the transaction, but,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for her to do so, she has to make public what \( \preimage \) is as she has to use it as the witness of the 
claiming transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bob sees that his BTC is spent, and looks at the witness to get \( \preimage \). Bob can then use \( \preimage \)
to claim the XTR transaction.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Doing atomic swaps with Monero is more complicated and requires a cryptographic dance to complete as Monero does not
implement any form of HTLC's or the like. This means that when doing an atomic swap with Monero, most of the logic will
have to be implemented on the Tari side. Atomic swaps between Monero and Bitcoin have been implemented by the <a href="https://github.com/farcaster-project/RFCs">Farcaster  project</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/comit-network/xmr-btc-swap">Comit team</a>. Due to the how TariScript works, we have a few
advantages over Bitcoin script regarding <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-to-scriptless-scripts#adaptor-signatures">adaptor signatures</a>, as the <a href="Glossary.html#script-keypair">script key</a> was explicitly designed with <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-to-scriptless-scripts">scriptless scripts</a> in mind.</p>
<h2 id="method"><a class="header" href="#method">Method</a></h2>
<p>The primary, happy path outline of a Tari - Monero atomic swap is described here, and more detail will follow. We assume
that Alice wants to trade her XTR for Bob's XMR.</p>
<ul>
<li>Negotiation - Both parties negotiate the value and other details of the Monero and Tari UTXO's.</li>
<li>Commitment - Both parties commit to the keys, nonces, inputs, and outputs to use for the transaction.</li>
<li>XTR payment - Alice makes the XTR payment to a UTXO containing a &quot;special&quot; script described below.</li>
<li>XMR Payment - The Monero payment is made to a multiparty <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-to-scriptless-scripts">scriptless script</a> UTXO.</li>
<li>Claim XTR - Bob redeems the XTR, and in doing so, reveals the XMR private key to Alice only.</li>
<li>Claim XMR - Alice may claim the XMR using the revealed key.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tldr"><a class="header" href="#tldr">TL;DR</a></h2>
<p>The scheme revolves around Alice, who wants to exchange her Tari for Bob's Monero. Because they don't trust each other, 
they have to commit some information to do the exchange. And if something goes wrong here, we want to ensure that we can 
refund both parties either in Monero or Tari.</p>
<p>How this works is that Alice and Bob create a shared output on both chains. The Monero output is a simple aggregate key 
to unlock the UTXO, while multiple keys are needed to unlock the Tari UTXO. An aggregate key locks this Monero UTXO that 
neither Alice nor Bob knows, but they both know half of the key. The current Tari block height determines the unlocking 
key for the Tari UTXO.</p>
<p>The process is started by Alice and Bob exchanging and committing to some information. Alice is the first to publish a 
transaction, which creates the Tari UTXO. If Bob is happy that the Tari UTXO has been mined and verifies all the 
information, he will publish a transaction to create the Monero UTXO.</p>
<p>The TariScript script on the UTXO ensures that they will have to reveal their portion of the Monero key when either 
Alice or Bob spends this. This disclosure allows the other party to claim the Monero by being the only one to own the 
complete Monero aggregate key.</p>
<p>We can visualize the happy path flow with the image below. 
<img src="assets/XTR_XMR_happy.png" alt="swap flow" /></p>
<p>The script will ensure that at any point in time, at least someone can claim the Tari UTXO, and if that person does so, 
the other party can claim the Monero UTXO by looking at the spending data. It has two lock heights, determining who can 
claim the Tari UTXO if the happy path fails. Before the first lock height, only Bob can claim the Tari; we call this the 
swap transaction.</p>
<p>If Bob disappears after Alice has posted the Tari UTXO, Alice can claim the Tari after the first lock height and before 
the second lock height; we call this the refund transaction. It ensures that Alice can reclaim her Tari if Bob 
disappears, and if Bob reappears, he can reclaim his Monero.</p>
<p>That leaves us with the scenario where Alice disappears after Bob posts the Monero transaction, in which case we need to 
protect Bob. After the second lock height, only Bob can claim the Tari; we call this the lapse transaction. The lapse 
transaction will reveal Bob's Monero key so that if Alice reappears, she can claim the Monero.</p>
<p>The image below details the time flow of the Tari transactions spending the Tari UTXO. 
<img src="assets/TXR_XMR_flow.png" alt="swap flow" /></p>
<h2 id="heights-security-and-other-considerations"><a class="header" href="#heights-security-and-other-considerations">Heights, Security, and other considerations</a></h2>
<p>We need to consider a few things for this to be secure, as there are possible scenarios that can reduce the security in the atomic swap. </p>
<p>When looking at the two lock heights, the first lock height should be sufficiently large enough to give ample time for Alice to post the Tari UTXO transaction and for it to be mined with a safe number of confirmations,
and for Bob to post the Monero transaction and for it to be mined with a safe number of confirmations. The second lock
height should give ample time for Alice after the first lock height to re-claim her Tari. Larger heights here might make
refunds slower, but it should be safer in giving more time to finalize this. </p>
<p>Allowing both to claim the Tari after the second lock height is, on face value, a safer option. This can be done by enabling
either party to claim the script with the lapse transaction. The counterparty can then claim the Monero. However, this
will open up an attack vector to enable either party to claim the Monero while claiming the Tari. Either party could trivially
pull off such a scheme by performing a front-running attack and having a bit of luck. The counterparty monitors all broadcast 
transactions to base nodes. Upon identifying the lapse transaction, they do two things; in quick succession, broadcast 
their lapse transaction and the transaction to claim the Monero, both with sufficiently high fees. Base nodes will 
prefer to mine transactions with the higher fees, and thus the counterparty can walk away with both the Tari and the 
Monero.</p>
<p>It is also possible to prevent the transaction from being mined after being submitted to the mempool. This can be caused by a combination
of a too busy network, not enough fees, or a too-small period in the time locks. When one of these atomic swap transactions gets published to a mempool, we effectively already have all the details exposed. For the atomic swaps, it means we already revealed part of the Monero key, although
the actual Tari transaction has not been mined. But this is true for any HTLC or like script on any blockchain. But in the odd
chance that this does happen whereby the fees are too little and time locks not enough, it should be possible to do a child-pays-for-parent
transaction to bump up the fees on the transaction to get it mined and confirmed.</p>
<h2 id="key-construction"><a class="header" href="#key-construction">Key construction</a></h2>
<p>Using <a href="https://reyify.com/blog/flipping-the-scriptless-script-on-schnorr">multi-signatures</a> with Schnorr signatures, we
need to ensure that the keys are constructed so that key cancellation attacks are not possible. To do this, we create new
keys from the chosen public keys \(K_a'\) and \(K_b'\)</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
K_a &amp;=  \hash{\hash{K_a' \cat K_b'} \cat K_a' } * K_a' \\
k_a &amp;=  \hash{\hash{K_a' \cat K_b'} \cat K_a' } * k_a' \\
K_b &amp;=  \hash{\hash{K_a' \cat K_b'} \cat K_b' } * K_b' \\
k_b &amp;=  \hash{\hash{K_a' \cat K_b'} \cat K_b' } * k_b' \\
\end{aligned}
\tag{1}
$$</p>
<h2 id="key-equivalence"><a class="header" href="#key-equivalence">Key equivalence</a></h2>
<p>Monero uses Ed25519, while Tari uses <a href="https://ristretto.group/">Ristretto</a> as its curve of choice. While Ristretto and Ed25519 both works on Curve25519 and the Edward
points are the same, they differ when the points are encoded. In practice, this means the following:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
Xm &amp;= x \cdot G_m \\
X &amp;= x \cdot G \\
X &amp;\neq X_m \\
\end{aligned}
\tag{2}
$$</p>
<p>To use public keys across different implementations or curves, we must prove that the same private key created the &quot;different&quot; public keys. Because we exchange encoded points, we need some way of proving they are the same.
<a href="https://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/files/260345149/Electronic_voting_application_based_on_public_verifiable_secret_sharing.pdf">Jepsen</a> designed a proof to prove Discrete Logarithm Equality (DLEQ) between two generator groups. But the proof here is not created for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) but can be adapted to ECC by:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
e &amp;= \hash{K_1 \cat K_2 \cat R_{1} \cat R_{2}} \\
s &amp;= r + e(k) \\
R_{1} &amp;= r \cdot G \\
R_{2} &amp;= r \cdot G_m \\
K_{1} &amp;= k \cdot G \\
K_{2} &amp;= k \cdot G_m \\
\end{aligned}
\tag{3}
$$</p>
<p>The verification is then:
$$
\begin{aligned}
e &amp;= \hash{K_1 \cat K_2 \cat R_{1} \cat R_{2}} \\
s \cdot G &amp;= R_{1} + e(K_1) \\
s \cdot G_m &amp;= R_{2} + e(K_2) \\
\end{aligned}
\tag{4}
$$</p>
<p>But this method has a problem with ECC keys as they are always used as \(mod(n)\) where n is the group size. With ECC, we cannot always use the method; it can only be used when the two curves are of the same group
size \(n\), or \(s &lt; n\). If this is not the case, a <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/resources/research-lab/pubs/MRL-0010.pdf">bit comparison</a> needs to be created to prove this.
But luckily, we use Ristretto and Ed25519, both on Curve25519, because it’s the same curve, same generator point, and just
different encodings. We can use this proof to know even though the encoded public keys do not match, they still share a private key</p>
<h2 id="key-security"><a class="header" href="#key-security">Key security</a></h2>
<p>The risk of publicly exposing part of the Monero private key is still secure because of how <a href="https://cryptobook.nakov.com/asymmetric-key-ciphers/elliptic-curve-cryptography-ecc#private-key-public-key-and-the-generator-point-in-ecc">ECC</a> works. We can
add two secret keys together and share the public version of both. And at the same time, we know that no one can calculate
the secret key with just one part.</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
(k_a + k_b) \cdot G &amp;= k_a \cdot G + k_b \cdot G\\
(k_a + k_b) \cdot G &amp;= K_a + K_b \\
(k_a + k_b) \cdot G &amp;= K \\
\end{aligned}
\tag{5}
$$</p>
<p>We know that \(K\), \(K_a\), \(K_b\) are public. While \(k\), \(k_a\), \(k_b\) are all private.</p>
<p>But if we expose \(k_b\), we can try to do the following:
$$
\begin{aligned}
(k_a + k_b) \cdot G &amp;= K_a + K_b\\
k_a \cdot G &amp;= (K_a + K_b - k_b \cdot G) \\
k_a \cdot G &amp;= K_a \\
\end{aligned}
\tag{6}
$$</p>
<p>However, this is the Elliptic-Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem, and there is no easy solution to solve this on current computer
hardware. Thus this is still secure even though we leaked part of the secret key \(k\).</p>
<h2 id="method-1"><a class="header" href="#method-1">Method 1</a></h2>
<h3 id="detail"><a class="header" href="#detail">Detail</a></h3>
<p>This method relies purely on TariScript to enforce the exposure of the private Monero aggregate keys. Based on <a href="https://suredbits.com/payment-points-part-1/">Point Time Lock Contracts</a>, the script forces the spending party to supply their Monero
private key part as input data to the script, evaluated via the operation <code>ToRistrettoPoint</code>. This TariScript operation will
publicly reveal part of the aggregated Monero private key, but this is still secure: see <a href="RFC-0241_AtomicSwapXMR.html#key-security">Key security</a>.</p>
<p>The simplicity of this method lies therein that the spending party creates all transactions on their 
own. Bob requires a pre-image from Alice to complete the swap transaction; Alice needs to verify that Bob published the 
Monero transaction and that everything is complete as they have agreed. If she is happy, she will provide Bob with the 
pre-image to claim the Tari UTXO.</p>
<h3 id="tariscript-1"><a class="header" href="#tariscript-1">TariScript</a></h3>

<p>This Request for Comment (RFC) presents a proposal for introducing <em>covenants</em> into the Tari base layer protocol. Tari
Covenants aims to provide restrictions on the <em>future</em> spending of subsequent transactions to enable a number of powerful
use-cases, such as</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hackingdistributed.com/2016/02/26/how-to-implement-secure-bitcoin-vaults/">vaults</a></li>
<li>side-chain checkpointing transactions,</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="introduction-5"><a class="header" href="#introduction-5">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Tari protocol already provides programmable consensus, through <a href="./Glossary.html#tariscript">TariScript</a>, that restricts whether a <a href="./Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>
may be included as an input to a transaction (a.k.a spent). The scope of information <a href="./Glossary.html#tariscript">TariScript</a> is inherently limited,
by the [TariScript Opcodes] and the input data provided by a spender. Once the requirements of the script are met,
a spender may generate <a href="./Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>s of their choosing, within the constraints of <a href="./Glossary.html#mimblewimble">MimbleWimble</a>.</p>
<p>This RFC aims to expand the capabilities of Tari protocol by adding <em>additional requirements</em>, called covenants
that allow the owner(s) of a <a href="./Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a> to control the composition of a <em>subsequent</em> transaction.</p>
<p>Covenants are not a new idea and have been proposed and implemented in various forms by others.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://maltemoeser.de/paper/covenants.pdf">Bitcoin-NG covenants</a> put forward the <code>CheckOutputVerify</code> script opcode.</li>
<li><a href="https://handshake.org/files/handshake.txt">Handshake</a> has implemented covenants to add the <a href="./Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a> state of their auctioning process.</li>
<li><a href="https://blockstream.com/2016/11/02/en-covenants-in-elements-alpha/">Elements Covenants</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="covenants-in-mimblewimble"><a class="header" href="#covenants-in-mimblewimble">Covenants in MimbleWimble</a></h2>
<p>In blockchains like Bitcoin, a block contains discrete transactions containing inputs and outputs. A covenant
in Bitcoin would be able to interrogate those outputs <em>belonging to the input</em> to ensure that they adhere to rules.</p>
<p>In <a href="./Glossary.html#mimblewimble">MimbleWimble</a>, the body of a block and transaction can be expressed in an identical data structure. This
is indeed the case in the <a href="https://github.com/tari-project/tari">Tari codebase</a>, which defines a structure called <code>AggregateBody</code> containing inputs
and outputs (and kernels) for transactions and blocks. This is innate to <a href="./Glossary.html#mimblewimble">MimbleWimble</a>, so even if we were
to put a &quot;box&quot; around these inputs/outputs there is nothing to stop someone from including inputs and
outputs from other boxes as long as balance is maintained.</p>
<p>This results in an interesting dilemma: how do we allow rules that dictate how future outputs look only armed with
the knowledge that the rule must apply to one or more outputs?</p>
<p>In this RFC, we propose a covenant scheme that allows the <a href="./Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a> originator to express a <em>filter</em> that must be
satisfied for a subsequent spending transaction to be considered valid.</p>
<h2 id="assumptions-3"><a class="header" href="#assumptions-3">Assumptions</a></h2>
<p>The following assumptions are made:</p>
<ol>
<li>Duplicate commitments within a block are disallowed by consensus <em>prior</em> to covenant execution,</li>
<li>all outputs in the output set are valid, and</li>
<li>all inputs are valid spends, save for covenant checks.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="protocol-modifications-1"><a class="header" href="#protocol-modifications-1">Protocol modifications</a></h2>
<p>Modifications to the existing protocol and consensus are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the covenant is recorded in the transaction <a href="./Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>,</li>
<li>the covenant is committed to in the output and input hashes to prevent malleability,</li>
<li>transactions with covenants entering the mempool MUST be validated, and</li>
<li>each covenant in a block must be validated before being included in the block chain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="transaction-input-and-output-changes"><a class="header" href="#transaction-input-and-output-changes">Transaction input and output changes</a></h3>
<p>A <code>covenant</code> field would need to be added to the <code>TransactionOutput</code> and <code>TransactionInput</code> structs
and committed to in their hashes.</p>
<h3 id="covenant-definition"><a class="header" href="#covenant-definition">Covenant definition</a></h3>
<p>We define a clear notation for covenants that mirrors the <a href="https://medium.com/blockstream/miniscript-bitcoin-scripting-3aeff3853620">miniscript</a> project.</p>
<h4 id="execution-context-and-scope"><a class="header" href="#execution-context-and-scope">Execution Context and Scope</a></h4>
<p>Covenants execute within a limited read-only context and scope. This is both to reduce complexity (and therefore
the possibility of bugs) and maintain reasonable performance.</p>
<p>A covenant's context is limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>an immutable reference to the current input,</li>
<li>a vector of immutable <em>references</em> to outputs in the current block/transaction (called the output set),</li>
<li>the current input's mined height, and</li>
<li>the current block height.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each output's covenant is executed with this context, filtering on the output set and returning the result.
The output set given to each covenant at execution MUST be the same set for all covenants and MUST never be
influenced by other covenants. The stateless and immutable nature of this scheme has the benefit of being
able to execute covenants in parallel.</p>
<p>A covenant passes if at least one output in the set is matched. Allowing more than one output to match allows for
covenants that restrict the characteristics of multiple outputs. A covenant that matches zero outputs <em>fails</em>
which invalidates the transaction/block.</p>
<p>If a covenant is empty (zero bytes) the <code>identity</code> operation is implied and therefore, no actual execution need occur.</p>

<h5 id="output-field-tags"><a class="header" href="#output-field-tags">Output field tags</a></h5>
<p>Fields from each output in the output set may be brought into a covenant filter.
The available fields are defined as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Tag Name</th><th>Byte Code</th><th>Returns</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>field::commitment</code></td><td>0x00</td><td>output.commitment</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>field::script</code></td><td>0x01</td><td>output.script</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
<p>Each field tag returns a consensus encoded byte representation of the value contained in the field.
How those bytes are interpreted depends on the covenant. For instance, <code>filter_fields_hashed_eq</code> will
concatenate the bytes and hash the result whereas <code>filter_field_int_eq</code> will interpret the bytes as a
little-endian 64-bit unsigned integer.</p>

<h4 id="encoding--decoding"><a class="header" href="#encoding--decoding">Encoding / Decoding</a></h4>
<p>Covenants can be encoded to/decoded from bytes as a token stream. Each token is consumed and interpreted serially
before being executed.</p>
<p>For instance,</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">xor(
    filter_output_hash_eq(Hash(0e0411c70df0ea4243a363fcbf161ebe6e2c1f074faf1c6a316a386823c3753c)),
    filter_relative_height(10),
)
</code></pre>
<p>is represented in hex bytes as <code>23 30 01 a8b3f48e39449e89f7ff699b3eb2b080a2479b09a600a19d8ba48d765fe5d47d 35 07 0a</code>.
Let's unpack that as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">23 // xor - consume two covenant args
30 // filter_output_hash_eq - consume a hash arg
01 // 32-byte hash
a8b3f48e39449e89f7ff699b3eb2b080a2479b09a600a19d8ba48d765fe5d47d // data
// end filter_output_hash_eq
35 // 2nd covenant - filter_relative_height
07 // varint
0A // 10
// end varint, filter_relative_height, xor
</code></pre>
<p>Some functions can take any number of arguments, such as <code>filter_fields_hashed_eq</code> which defines the <code>Fields</code> type.
This type is encoded first by its byte code <code>34</code> followed by a varint encoded number that indicates the number
of field identifiers to consume. To mitigate misuse, the maximum allowed arguments are limited.</p>
<h3 id="covenant-validation"><a class="header" href="#covenant-validation">Covenant Validation</a></h3>
<p>A covenant and therefore the block/transaction MUST be regarded as invalid if:</p>
<ol>
<li>an unrecognised bytecode is encountered</li>
<li>the end of the byte stream is reached unexpectedly</li>
<li>there are bytes remaining on the stream after interpreting</li>
<li>an invalid argument type is encountered</li>
<li>the <code>Fields</code> type encounters more than 9 arguments (i.e. the number of fields tags available)</li>
<li>the depth of the calls exceeds 16.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="consensus-changes-1"><a class="header" href="#consensus-changes-1">Consensus changes</a></h3>
<p>The covenant is executed once all other validations, including <a href="./Glossary.html#tariscript">TariScript</a>, are complete. This ensures that
invalid transactions in a block cannot influence the results.</p>
<h2 id="considerations"><a class="header" href="#considerations">Considerations</a></h2>
<h3 id="complexity"><a class="header" href="#complexity">Complexity</a></h3>
<p>This introduces additional validation complexity. We avoid stacks, loops, and conditionals (covenants are basically
one conditional), there are overheads both in terms of complexity and performance as a trade-off for the
power given by covenants.</p>
<p>The worst case complexity for covenant validation is <code>O(num_inputs*num_outputs)</code>, although as mentioned above
validation for each input can be executed in parallel. To compensate for the additional workload the network
encounters, use of covenants should incur heavily-weighted fees to discourage needlessly using them.</p>
<h3 id="cut-through-1"><a class="header" href="#cut-through-1">Cut-through</a></h3>
<p>The same arguments made in the <a href="./RFC-0201_TariScript.html#cut-through">TariScript RFC</a> for the need to prevent

<h3 id="security"><a class="header" href="#security">Security</a></h3>
<p>As all outputs in a block are in the scope of an input to be checked, any unrelated/malicious output in a block
<em>could</em> pass an unrelated covenant rule if given the chance. A secure covenant is one that <em>uniquely</em> identifies
one or more outputs.</p>

<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe Validator Node (VN) registration. Registration accomplishes two goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provides a register of Validator Nodes with an authority (the Tari base layer).</li>
<li>Offers Sybil resistance against gaining probabilistic majority of any given publicly nominated VN committee.</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<h2 id="description-18"><a class="header" href="#description-18">Description</a></h2>
<p>VNs register themselves on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">Base layer</a> using a special <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> type. The registration
<a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> type requires the spending of a certain minimum amount of <a href="Glossary.html#tari-coin">Tari coin</a>, the (<a href="Glossary.html#registration-deposit">Registration Deposit</a>),
which has a time lock on the output for a minimum amount of time (<a href="Glossary.html#registration-term">Registration Term</a>), as well as some metadata, such as
the VN's public key.</p>
<p>The Node ID is calculated after registration to prevent mining of VN public keys that can be used to manipulate routing
on the Distributed Hash Table (DHT).</p>
<p>Once a VN's <a href="Glossary.html#registration-term">Registration Term</a> has expired, so will this specific VN registration. The Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)
time lock will have elapsed so
the <a href="Glossary.html#registration-deposit">Registration Deposit</a> can be reclaimed and a new VN registration needs to be performed. This automatic
registration expiry will ensure that the VN registry stays up to date with active VN registrations, and inactive
registrations will naturally be removed.</p>
<p>Requiring nodes to register themselves serves two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>makes VN Sybil attacks expensive; and</li>
<li>provides an authoritative &quot;central-but-not-centralized&quot; registry of VNs from the base layer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="node-id"><a class="header" href="#node-id">Node ID</a></h3>
<p>The VN ID can be calculated deterministically after the VN registration transaction is mined. This ensures
that VNs are randomly distributed over the DHT network.</p>
<p>VN IDs MUST be calculated as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text"> NodeId = Hash( pk || h || kh )
</code></pre>
<p>Where</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Field</th><th align="left">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">pk</td><td align="left">The VN's DHT public key</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">h</td><td align="left">The block height of the block in which the registration transaction was mined</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">kh</td><td align="left">The hash of the registration transaction's kernel</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Base Nodes SHOULD maintain a cached list of VNs and MUST return the Node ID in response to a
<code>get_validator_node_id</code> request.</p>
<h3 id="validator-node-registration-1"><a class="header" href="#validator-node-registration-1">Validator Node Registration</a></h3>
<p>A VN MUST register on the base layer before it can join any Distributed Area Network (DAN) <a href="Glossary.html#committee">committee</a>s. Registration 
happens by virtue
of a VN registration <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a>.</p>
<p>VN registrations are valid for the <a href="Glossary.html#registration-term">Registration Term</a>.</p>
<p>The registration term is set at SIX months.</p>
<p>A VN registration transaction is a special transaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>The transaction MUST have EXACTLY ONE UTXO with the <code>VN_Deposit</code> flag set.</li>
<li>This UTXO MUST also:
<ul>
<li>set a time lock for AT LEAST the <a href="Glossary.html#registration-term">Registration Term</a> (or equivalent block periods);</li>
<li>provide the <em>value</em> of the UTXO in the signature metadata; and</li>
<li>provide the <em>public key</em> for the spending key for the output in the signature metadata.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The value of this output MUST be equal to or greater than the <a href="Glossary.html#registration-deposit">Registration Deposit</a>.</li>
<li>The UTXO MUST store:
<ul>
<li>the value of the VN deposit UTXO as a u64; and</li>
<li>the value of the <em>public key</em> for the spending key for the output as 32 bytes in little-endian order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>KernelFeatures</code> bit flag MUST have the <code>VN_Registration</code> flag set.</li>
<li>The kernel MUST also store the VN's DHT public key as 32 bytes in little-endian order.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="validator-node-registration-renewal"><a class="header" href="#validator-node-registration-renewal">Validator Node Registration Renewal</a></h3>
<p>If a VN owner does not <em>renew</em> the registration before the <a href="Glossary.html#registration-term">Registration Term</a> has expired, the registration will lapse
and the VN will no longer be allowed to participate in any <a href="Glossary.html#committee">committee</a>s.</p>
<p>The number of consecutive renewals MAY increase the VN's reputation score.</p>
<p>A VN may only renew a registration in the TWO-WEEK period prior to the current term expiring.</p>
<p>A VN renewal transaction is a special transaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>The transaction MUST have EXACTLY ONE UTXO with the <code>VN_Deposit</code> flag set.</li>
<li>The transaction MUST spend the previous VN deposit UTXO for this VN.</li>
<li>This UTXO MUST also:
<ul>
<li>set a time lock for AT LEAST six months (or equivalent block periods);</li>
<li>provide the <em>value</em> of the transaction in the signature metadata; and</li>
<li>provide the <em>public key</em> for the spending key for the output in the signature metadata.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This UTXO MUST also store:
<ul>
<li>The value of the VN deposit UTXO as a u64.</li>
<li>The value of the <em>public key</em> for the spending key for the output as 32 bytes in little-endian order;</li>
<li>The VN's Node ID. This can be validated by following the Renewal transaction kernel chain.</li>
<li>The kernel hash of this transaction's kernel.</li>
<li>A counter indicating that this is the n-th consecutive renewal. This counter will be confirmed by nodes and miners.
The first renewal will have a counter value of one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The previous VN deposit UTXO MUST NOT be spendable in a standard transaction (i.e. its time lock has not expired).</li>
<li>The previous VN deposit UTXO MUST expire within the next TWO WEEKS.</li>
<li>The transaction MAY provide additional inputs to cover transaction fees and increases in the <a href="Glossary.html#registration-deposit">Registration Deposit</a>.</li>
<li>The transaction kernel MUST have the <code>VN_Renewal</code> bit flag set.</li>
<li>The transaction kernel MUST also store the hash of the previous renewal transaction kernel, or the registration kernel, 
if this is the first renewal.</li>
</ul>
<p>One will notice that a VN's Node ID does not change as a result of a renewal transaction. Rather, every
renewal adds to a chain linking back to the original registration transaction. It may be desirable to establish a long
chain of renewals, in order to offer evidence of longevity and improve a VN's reputation.</p>

<h2 id="description-19"><a class="header" href="#description-19">Description</a></h2>
<h3 id="abstract-3"><a class="header" href="#abstract-3">Abstract</a></h3>
<p>This document will describe the process through which an AI will go in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>register a DA on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a>;</li>
<li>assemble a <a href="Glossary.html#committee">committee</a> of <a href="Glossary.html#validator-node">Validator Node</a>s (VNs); and</li>
<li>commence operation of the DA on the DAN.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asset-creation-instruction"><a class="header" href="#asset-creation-instruction">Asset Creation Instruction</a></h3>
<p>The first step in registering and commencing the operation of an asset is that the AI MUST issue an asset creation 
transaction to the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a>.</p>
<p>This transaction will be time-locked for the length of the desired nomination period. This ensures that this transaction 
cannot be spent until the nomination period has elapsed so that it is present during the entire nomination process. The 
value of the transaction will be the <code>asset_creation_fee</code> described in <a href="RFC-0311_AssetTemplates.html">RFC-0311</a>. The AI 
will spend the transaction back to themselves, but locking this fee up at this stage achieves two goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Firstly, it makes 
it expensive to spam the network with asset creation transactions that a malicious AI does not intend to complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, it proves to the VNs that participate in the nomination process that the AI does indeed have the funds 
required to commence operation of the asset once the committee has been selected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the asset registration process 
fails, e.g. if there are not enough available VNs for the committee, then the AI can refund the fee to themselves 
after the time lock expires.</p>
<p>The transaction will contain the following extra metadata to facilitate the registration process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The value of the transaction in clear text and the public spending key of the commitment so that it can be verified 
by third parties. A third party can verify the value of the commitment by using the information in (1) and (2) below, to calculate (3):</p>
<ol>
<li>The output commitment is $ C = k \cdot G + v \cdot H $.</li>
<li>$ v​ $ and $ k \cdot G ​$ are provided in the metadata.</li>
<li>A verifier can calculate $ C - k \cdot G = v \cdot H $ and verify this value by multiplying the clear text $ v $ by $ H $ themselves.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A commitment (hash) to the asset parameters as defined by a <a href="Glossary.html#digitalassettemplate">DigitalAssetTemplate</a> described in 
<a href="RFC-0311_AssetTemplates.html">RFC-0311</a>. This template will define all the parameters of the asset that the AI intends to 
register, including information the VNs need to know, such as what  <a href="Glossary.html#assetcollateral">AssetCollateral</a> is required to be part of the committee.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once this transaction has been confirmed to the required depth on the blockchain, the nomination phase can begin.</p>
<h3 id="nomination-phase"><a class="header" href="#nomination-phase">Nomination Phase</a></h3>
<p>The next step in registering an asset is for the AI to select a committee of VNs to manage the asset. The process to do 
this is described in <a href="RFC-0304_VNCommittees.html">RFC-0304</a>. This process lasts as long as the time lock on the asset 
creation transaction described above. The VNs have until that time lock elapses to nominate themselves (in the case of 
an asset being registered using the <code>committee_mode::PUBLIC_NOMINATION</code> parameter in the <a href="Glossary.html#digitalassettemplate">DigitalAssetTemplate</a>).</p>
<h3 id="asset-commencement"><a class="header" href="#asset-commencement">Asset Commencement</a></h3>
<p>Once the nomination phase is complete and the AI has selected a committee as described in <a href="RFC-0304_VNCommittees.html">RFC-0304</a>, 
the chosen committee and AI are ready to commit their <code>asset_creation_fee</code> and <a href="Glossary.html#assetcollateral">AssetCollateral</a>s to commence the 
operation of the asset. This is done by the AI and the committee members collaborating to build the initial <a href="Glossary.html#checkpoint">Checkpoint</a> 
of the asset. When this <a href="Glossary.html#checkpoint">Checkpoint</a> transaction is published to the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a>, the <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">digital asset</a> will be live on 
the DAN. The <a href="Glossary.html#checkpoint">Checkpoint</a> transaction is described in <a href="RFC-0220_AssetCheckpoints.html">RFC_0220</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">Digital Asset</a>s (DAs) are managed by committees of special nodes called <a href="Glossary.html#validator-node">Validator Node</a>s (VNs):</p>
<ul>
<li>VNs manage digital asset state change and ensure that the rules of the asset contracts are enforced.</li>
<li>VNs form a peer-to-peer communication network that together defines the Tari DAN.</li>
<li>VNs register themselves on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a> and commit collateral to prevent Sybil attacks.</li>
<li>Scalability is achieved by sacrificing decentralization. Not <em>all</em> VNs manage <em>every</em> asset. Assets are managed by
subsets of the DAN, called VN <a href="Glossary.html#committee">committees</a>. These committees reach consensus on DA state amongst themselves.</li>
<li>VNs earn fees for their efforts.</li>
<li>DA contracts are not Turing complete, but are instantiated by <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer">Asset Issuer</a>s (AIs) using <a href="Glossary.html#digitalassettemplate">DigitalAssetTemplate</a>s that are defined
in the DAN protocol code.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="digital-assets"><a class="header" href="#digital-assets">Digital Assets</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>DA contracts are <em>not</em> Turing complete, but are selected from a set of <a href="Glossary.html#digitalassettemplate">DigitalAssetTemplate</a>s that govern
the behaviour of each contract type. For example, there could be a Single-use Token template for simple ticketing systems, a
Coupon template for loyalty programmes, and so on.</li>
<li>The template system is intended to be highly flexible and additional templates can be added to the protocol periodically.</li>
<li>Asset issuers can link a Registered Asset Issuer Domain (RAID) ID in an OpenAlias TXT public Domain Name System (DNS) 
record to a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that they own. This is to help disambiguate similar
contracts and improve the signal-to-noise ratio from scam or copycat contracts.</li>
</ul>
<p>An AI will issue a DA by constructing a contract from one of the supported set of <a href="Glossary.html#digitalassettemplate">DigitalAssetTemplate</a>s. The AI will choose
how large the committee of VNs will be for this DA, and have the option to nominate <a href="Glossary.html#trusted-node">Trusted Node</a>s to be part of the VN 
committee for the DA.
Any remaining spots on the committee will be filled by permissionless VNs that are selected according to a 
<a href="Glossary.html#committeeselectionstrategy">CommitteeSelectionStrategy</a>. This is a strategy that an AI will use to select from the set of potential candidate VNs 
that nominated themselves for a position on the committee when the AI broadcast a public call for VNs during the asset 
creation process. For the VNs to accept the appointment to the committee, they will need to put up the specified collateral.</p>

<h3 id="alternative-approaches"><a class="header" href="#alternative-approaches">Alternative Approaches</a></h3>
<p>In order to easily differentiate <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">digital asset</a>s in the DAN, apart from some unique unpronounceable 
character string, a human-readable identifier (domain name) is required. It is perceived that shorter names will have 
higher value due to branding and marketability. The question is, how this can be managed elegantly? It is also 
undesirable if, for example, the real Disney is forced to use the long versioned &quot;<em>disney.com-goofy-is-my-asset-yes</em>&quot; 
because some fake Disneys claimed &quot;<em>goofy</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>disney.com-goofy</em>&quot; and everything in-between.</p>
<p>One method to curb name space squatting is to register names on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a> layer with a domain name registration 
transaction. Let us call such a name a Registered Asset Issuer Name (RAIN). To make registering RAINs difficult enough 
to prevent spamming the network, a certain amount of <a href="Glossary.html#tari-coin">Tari coins</a> must be committed in a burn (permanently destroy) or 
a time-locked pay-to-self type transaction. Lots of management overhead will be associated with such a scheme, even if 
domainless assets are allowed. However, it would be impossible to stop someone 
from registering, say, a &quot;<em>disney.com</em>&quot; RAIN if they did not own the real &quot;<em>disney.com</em>&quot; Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).</p>
<p>Another approach would be to make use of the public Domain Name System (DNS) and to link the FQDNs that are already 
registered, to the <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">digital asset</a>s in the DAN, making use of <a href="https://openalias.org/">OpenAlias</a> text (TXT) DNS 
records on an FQDN. Let us call this a Registered Asset Issuer Domain (RAID) TXT record. If we hash a public key and 
FQDN pair, it will provide us with a unique RAID_ID (RAID Identification). The RAID_ID will serve a similar purpose in 
the DAN as a Top Level Domain (TLD) in a DNS, as all digital assets belonging to a specific <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer">asset issuer</a> could then 
be grouped under the FQDN by inference. To make this scheme more elaborate, but potentially unnecessary, all such 
RAID_IDs could also be registered on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a>, similar to the RAIN scheme.</p>
<p>If the standard Mimblewimble protocol is followed, a new output feature can be defined to cater for a RAID tuple 
<code>(RAID_ID, PubKey)</code> that is linked to a specific Unspent Transaction Output (<a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>). The <code>RAID_ID</code> could be based on 
a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding">Base58Check</a> variant applied to <code>Hash256(PubKey || FQDN)</code>. If the 
amount of Tari coins associated with the RAID tuple transaction is burned, <code>(RAID_ID, PubKey)</code> will forever be present 
on the blockchain and can increase blockchain bloat. On the other hand, if those <a href="Glossary.html#tari-coin">Tari coins</a> are spent back to their 
owner with a specific time lock, it will be possible to spend and prune that UTXO later on. While that UTXO remains 
unspent, the RAID tuple will be valid, but when all or part of it is spent, the RAID tuple will disappear from the 
blockchain. Such a UTXO will thus be &quot;coloured&quot; while unspent, as it will have different properties to a normal UTXO. It 
will also be possible to recreate the original RAID tuple by registering it using the original <code>Hash256(PubKey || FQDN)</code>.</p>
<p>Thinking about the make-up of the <code>RAID_ID</code>, it is evident that it can easily be calculated on the fly using the public 
key and FQDN, the values of which will always be known. The biggest advantage of having the RAID tuple on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base 
layer</a> is that of embedded consensus, where it will be validated (as no duplicates can be allowed) and mined before it 
can be used. However, this comes at the cost of more complex code, a more elaborate asset registration process and 
higher asset registration fees.</p>

<p>This RFC explores the creation and use of RAID TXT records to link asset issuer-specified domain names with 
digital assets on the <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset-network">DAN</a>, without RAID_IDs being registered on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="requirements"><a class="header" href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<h3 id="openalias-txt-dns-records"><a class="header" href="#openalias-txt-dns-records">OpenAlias TXT DNS Records</a></h3>
<p>An OpenAlias TXT DNS record [<a href="https://docs.rs/openalias/0.2.0/openalias/index.html" title="Crate openalias">1</a>] on an FQDN is a single string and starts with &quot;<em>oa1:&lt;name&gt;</em>&quot; field followed by a 
number of key-value pairs. Standard (optional) key values are: &quot;<em>recipient_address</em>&quot;; &quot;<em>recipient_name</em>&quot;; 
&quot;<em>tx_description</em>&quot;; &quot;<em>tx_amount</em>&quot;; &quot;<em>tx_payment_id</em>&quot;; &quot;<em>address_signature</em>&quot;; and &quot;<em>checksum</em>&quot;. Additional key values 
may also be defined. Only entities with write access to a specific DNS record will be able to create the required TXT 
DNS record entries.</p>
<p>TXT DNS records are limited to multiple strings of size 255, and as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) size is 512 bytes, 
a TXT DNS record that exceeds that limit is less optimal [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208" title="RFC 7208">2</a>, Sections 3.3 and 3.4]. Some hosting sites also place 
limitations on TXT DNS record string lengths and concatenation of multiple strings as per [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208" title="RFC 7208">2</a>]. The basic idea of this 
specification is to make the implementation robust and flexible at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - Integration with public DNS records MUST be used to ensure valid ownership of an FQDN that needs to be 
linked to a <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">digital asset</a> on the DAN. </p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - The total size of the OpenAlias TXT DNS record SHOULD NOT exceed 255 characters.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - The total size of the OpenAlias TXT DNS record MUST NOT exceed 512 characters.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - The OpenAlias TXT DNS record implementation MUST make provision to interpret entries that are made up of more 
than one string as defined in [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208" title="RFC 7208">2</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - The OpenAlias TXT DNS record SHOULD adhere to the formatting requirements as specified in [<a href="https://docs.rs/openalias/0.2.0/openalias/index.html" title="Crate openalias">1</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - The OpenAlias TXT DNS record MUST be constructed as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>OpenAlias TXT DNS Record Field</th><th>OpenAlias TXT DNS Record Data</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>oa1:&lt;name&gt;</td><td>&quot;oa1:tari&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>pk</td><td>&lt;256 bit public key, in hexadecimal format (64 characters), that is converted into a <code>Base58</code> encoded string (44 characters)&gt;</td></tr>
<tr><td>raid_id</td><td>&lt;<code>RAID_ID</code> (<em>refer to <a href="RFC-0301_NamespaceRegistration.html#raid_id">RAID_ID</a></em>) (15 characters)&gt;</td></tr>

<h3 id="raid_id"><a class="header" href="#raid_id">RAID_ID</a></h3>
<p>Because the <code>RAID_ID</code> does not exist as an entity on the base layer or in the <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset-network">DAN</a>, it cannot be owned or 
transferred, but can only be verified as part of the OpenAlias TXT DNS record [<a href="https://docs.rs/openalias/0.2.0/openalias/index.html" title="Crate openalias">1</a>] verification. If an asset creator 
chooses not to link a <code>RAID_ID</code> and FQDN, a default network-assigned <code>RAID_ID</code> will be used in the digital asset 
registration process.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - A default <code>RAID_ID</code> MUST be used where it will not be linked to an FQDN, e.g. it MAY be derived
from a default input string <code>&quot;No FQDN&quot;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - An FQDN-linked (non-default) <code>RAID_ID</code> MUST be derived from the concatenation <code>PubKey || &lt;FQDN&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - All concatenations of inputs for any hash algorithm MUST be done without adding any spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - The hash algorithm MUST be <code>Blake2b</code> using a 32 byte digest size, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - Deriving a <code>RAID_ID</code> MUST be calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inputs for all hashing algorithms used to calculate the <code>RAID_ID</code> MUST be lower-case characters.</li>
<li>Stage 1 - MUST select the input string to use (either <code>&quot;No FQDN&quot;</code> or <code>PubKey || &lt;FQDN&gt;</code>).
<ul>
<li>Example: Mimblewimble public key <code>ca469346d7643336c19155fdf5c6500a5232525ce4eba7e4db757639159e9861</code> and FQDN 
<code>disney.com</code> are used here, resulting in <code>ca469346d7643336c19155fdf5c6500a5232525ce4eba7e4db757639159e9861disney.com</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stage 2 - MUST perform <code>Blake2b</code> hashing on the result of stage 1 using a 10 byte digest size.
<ul>
<li>Example: In hexadecimal representation <code>ff517a1387153cc38009</code> or binary representation<code>\xffQz\x13\x87\x15&lt;\xc3\x80\t</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stage 3 - MUST concatenate the <code>RAID_ID</code> identifier byte, <code>0x62</code>, with the result of stage 2.
<ul>
<li>Example: <code>62ff517a1387153cc38009</code> `.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stage 4 - MUST convert the result of stage 3 from a byte string into a <code>Base58</code> encoded string. 
This will result in a 15 character string starting with <code>R</code>.
<ul>
<li>Example: The resulting <code>RAID_ID</code> will be <code>RYqMMuSmBZFQkgp</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - A valid <code>RAID_ID</code> signature MUST be a 256 bit Schnorr signature defined as <code>s = PvtNonce + e·PvtKey</code> with 
the challenge <code>e</code> being <code>e = Blake2b(PubNonce || PubKey || RAID_ID)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="sequence-of-events"><a class="header" href="#sequence-of-events">Sequence of Events</a></h3>
<p>The sequence of events leading up to digital asset registration is perceived as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer">asset issuer</a> will decide if the default <code>RAID_ID</code> or a <code>RAID_ID</code> that is linked to an FQDN must be used for 
asset registration. 
(<em><strong>Note:</strong> A single linked (<code>RAID_ID</code>, FQDN) tuple may be associated with multiple digital assets from the same 
asset issuer.</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - If a default <code>RAID_ID</code> is required:</p>
<ol>
<li>The asset issuer MUST use the default <code>RAID_ID</code> (refer to <a href="RFC-0301_NamespaceRegistration.html#raid_id">RAID_ID</a>).</li>
<li>The asset issuer MUST NOT sign the <code>RAID_ID</code>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - If a linked (<code>RAID_ID</code>, FQDN) tuple is required:</p>
<ol>
<li>The asset issuer MUST create a <code>RAID_ID</code>.</li>
<li>The asset issuer MUST sign the <code>RAID_ID</code> as specified (refer to <a href="RFC-0301_NamespaceRegistration.html#raid_id">RAID_ID</a>).</li>
<li>The asset issuer MUST create a valid TXT DNS record (refer to <a href="RFC-0301_NamespaceRegistration.html#openalias-txt-dns-records">OpenAlias TXT DNS Records</a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - <a href="Glossary.html#validator-node">Validator Node</a>s (VNs) MUST only allow a valid <code>RAID_ID</code> to be used in the digital asset registration 
process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - VNs MUST verify the OpenAlias TXT DNS record if a linked (<code>RAID_ID</code>, FQDN) tuple is used:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify that all fields have been completed as per the specification (refer to 
<a href="RFC-0301_NamespaceRegistration.html#openalias-txt-dns-records">OpenAlias TXT DNS Records</a>).</li>
<li>Verify that the <code>RAID_ID</code> can be calculated from information provided in the TXT DNS record and the FQDN of the 
public DNS record it is in.</li>
<li>Verify that the asset issuer's <code>RAID_ID</code> signature is valid.</li>
<li>Verify the checksum.</li>

for this function are
still being discussed.</p>
<h4 id="registration"><a class="header" href="#registration">Registration</a></h4>
<p>VNs register themselves on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">Base Layer</a> using a special <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> type.</p>
<p>Validator node registration is described in <a href="RFC-0322_VNRegistration.html">RFC-0322</a>.</p>
<h4 id="execution-of-instructions"><a class="header" href="#execution-of-instructions">Execution of Instructions</a></h4>
<p>VNs are expected to manage the state of DAs on behalf of DA issuers. They receive fees as reward
for doing this.</p>
<ul>
<li>DAs consist of an initial state plus a set of state transition rules. These rules are set by the Tari
protocol, but will usually provide parameters that must be specified by the <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer">Asset Issuer</a>.</li>
<li>The set of VNs that participate in managing state of a specific DA is called a <a href="Glossary.html#committee">Committee</a>. A committee is selected 
during the asset
issuance process and membership of the committee can be updated at <a href="Glossary.html#checkpoint">Checkpoint</a>s.</li>
<li>The VN is responsible for ensuring that every state change in a DA conforms to the contract's rules.</li>
<li>VNs accept DA <a href="Glossary.html#instructions">Instructions</a> from clients and peers. Instructions allow for creating, updating, expiring and 
archiving DAs on the DAN.</li>
<li>VNs provide additional collateral, called <a href="Glossary.html#assetcollateral">AssetCollateral</a>, when accepting an offer to manage an asset, which is 
stored in a multi-signature (multi-sig)
Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) on the base layer. This collateral can be taken from the VN if it is proven that the 
VN engaged in
malicious behaviour.</li>
<li>VNs participate in fraud-proof validations in the event of consensus disputes (which could result in the malicious VN's
collateral being slashed).</li>
<li>DA metadata (e.g. large images) is managed by VNs. The large data itself will not be stored on the VNs, but 
in an external location, and a hash of the data can be stored. Whether the data is considered part of the state
(and thus checkpointed) or out of state depends on the type of DA contract employed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fees"><a class="header" href="#fees">Fees</a></h4>
<p>Fees will be paid to VNs based on the amount of work they did during a checkpoint period. The fees will be paid from a 
fee pool, which will be collected
and reside in a UTXO that is accessible by the committee. The exact mechanism for the payment of the fees by the 
committee and who pays the various
types of fees is still under discussion.</p>
<h4 id="checkpoints"><a class="header" href="#checkpoints">Checkpoints</a></h4>
<p>VNs periodically post checkpoint summaries to the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a> for each asset that they are managing. The checkpoints 
will form an immutable
record of the DA state on the base layer. There will be two types of checkpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An Opening Checkpoint (OC) will:</p>
<ul>
<li>specify the members of the VN committee;</li>
<li>lock up the collateral for the committee members for this checkpoint period; and</li>
<li>collect the fee pool for this checkpoint period from the Asset Issuer into a multi-sig UTXO under the control of the 
committee.
This can be a top-up of the fees or a whole new fee pool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Closing Checkpoint (CC) will:</p>
<ul>
<li>summarize the DA state on the base layer;</li>
<li>release the fee payouts;</li>
<li>release the collateral for the committee members for this checkpoint period; and</li>
<li>allow for committee members to resign from the committee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After a DA is issued, there will immediately be an OC. After a checkpoint period there will then be a 
CC, followed
immediately by an OC for the next period. We will call this set of checkpoints an Intermediate checkpoint, which could be a compressed combination of an OC and CC. This will continue
until the end of the asset's lifetime, when there will be a final CC that will be followed by the retirement of the asset.</p>

<h4 id="consensus"><a class="header" href="#consensus">Consensus</a></h4>
<p>Committees of VNs will use a <a href="Glossary.html#consensusstrategy">ConsensusStrategy</a> to manage the process of:</p>
<ul>
<li>propagating signed instructions between members of the committee; and</li>
<li>determining when the threshold has been reached for an instruction to be considered valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of the Consensus Strategy will be mechanisms for detecting actions by <a href="Glossary.html#bad-actor">Bad Actor</a>s. The nature of the enforcement 
actions that can be taken
against bad actors is still to be decided.</p>
<h3 id="network-communication"><a class="header" href="#network-communication">Network Communication</a></h3>
<p>The VNs will communicate using a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. To facilitate this, the VNs must perform the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>VNs MUST maintain a list of peers, including which assets each peer is managing.</li>
<li>VNs MUST relay <a href="Glossary.html#instructions">instructions</a> to members of the committee that are managing the relevant asset.</li>
<li>VNs MUST respond to requests for information about DAs that they manage on the DAN.</li>
<li>VNs and clients can advertise public keys to facilitate P2P communication encryption.</li>

<p><a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">Digital Asset</a>s (DAs) are managed by <a href="Glossary.html#committee">committee</a>s of nodes called <a href="Glossary.html#validator-node">Validator Node</a>s (VNs), as described in 
<a href="RFC-0300_DAN.html">RFC-0300</a> and <a href="RFC-0302_ValidatorNodes.html">RFC-0302</a>. During the asset creation process, described in 
<a href="RFC-0341_AssetRegistration.html">RFC-0341</a>, the <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer">Asset Issuer</a> (AI) MUST select a committee of VNs to manage their asset. 
This process consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Candidate VNs MUST be nominated to be considered for selection by the AI.</li>
<li>The AI MUST employ a <a href="Glossary.html#committeeselectionstrategy">CommitteeSelectionStrategy</a> to select VNs from the set of nominated candidates.</li>
<li>The AI MUST make an offer of committee membership to the selected VNs.</li>
<li>Selected VNs MAY accept the offer to become part of the committee by posting the required <a href="Glossary.html#assetcollateral">AssetCollateral</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="nomination"><a class="header" href="#nomination">Nomination</a></h3>
<p>The first step in assembling a committee is to nominate candidate VNs. As described in 
<a href="RFC-0311_AssetTemplates.html">RFC-0311</a>, an asset can be created with two possible <code>committee_modes</code> - <code>CREATOR_NOMINATION</code> 
or <code>PUBLIC_NOMINATION</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <code>CREATOR_NOMINATION</code> mode, the AI nominates candidate committee members directly. The AI will have a list of permissioned 
<a href="Glossary.html#trusted-node">Trusted Node</a>s that they want to act as the committee. The AI will contact the candidate VNs directly to inform them of 
their nomination.</li>
<li>In <code>PUBLIC_NOMINATION</code> mode, the AI does not have a list of <a href="Glossary.html#trusted-node">Trusted Node</a>s and wants to source unknown VNs from the 
network. In this case, the AI broadcasts a public call for nomination to the Tari network using the peer-to-peer messaging 
protocol described in <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html">RFC-0172</a>. This call for nomination contains all the 
details of the asset. VNs that want to participate will then nominate themselves by contacting the AI.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="selection"><a class="header" href="#selection">Selection</a></h3>
<p>Once the AI has received a list of nominated VNs, it must make a selection, assuming enough VNs were nominated to populate 
the committee. The AI will employ some <a href="Glossary.html#committeeselectionstrategy">CommitteeSelectionStrategy</a> in order to select the committee from the candidate 
VNs that have been nominated. This strategy might aim for a perfectly random selection, or perhaps it will consider some 
metrics about the candidate VNs, such as the length of their VN registrations. These metrics might indicate that they are reliable 
and have not been denylisted for poor or malicious performance.</p>
<p>A consideration when selecting a committee in <code>PUBLIC_NOMINATION</code> mode will be the size of the pool of nominated VNs. 
The size of this pool relative to the size of the committee to be selected will be linked to a risk profile. If the pool 
contains very few candidates, then it will be much easier for an attacker to have nominated their own nodes in order to 
obtain a majority membership of the committee. For example, if the AI is selecting a committee of 10 members using a uniformly 
random selection strategy and only 12 public nominations are received, an attacker only requires control of six VNs to 
achieve a majority position in the committee. In contrast, if 100 nominations are received and the AI performs a 
uniformly random selection, an attacker would need to control more than 50 of the nominated nodes in order to achieve a 
majority position in the committee.</p>
<h3 id="offer-acceptance"><a class="header" href="#offer-acceptance">Offer Acceptance</a></h3>
<p>Once the selection has been made by the AI, the selected VNs will be informed and they will be made an offer of membership. 
If the VNs are still inclined to join the committee, they will accept the offer by posting the <a href="Glossary.html#assetcollateral">AssetCollateral</a> 
required by the asset to the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a> during the initial <a href="Glossary.html#checkpoint">Checkpoint</a> transaction built to commence the operation of 
the asset.</p>

<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe the Tari Digital Asset templating system for smart contract 
definition.</p>
<p>The term “smart contracts” in this document is used to refer to a set of rules enforced by computers. These smart
contracts are not Turing complete, such as those executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (VM).</p>
<h2 id="related-requests-for-comment-30"><a class="header" href="#related-requests-for-comment-30">Related Requests for Comment</a></h2>

<h2 id="description-24"><a class="header" href="#description-24">Description</a></h2>
<h3 id="motivation"><a class="header" href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h3>
<p>The reasons for issuing assets on Tari under a templating system, rather than a scripting language (whether Turing
complete or not), are manifold:</p>
<ul>
<li>A scripting language, irrespective of how simple it is, limits the target market for asset issuers to developers, or
people who pay developers.</li>
<li>The market doesn’t want general smart contracts. This is evidenced by the fact that the vast majority of Ethereum
transactions go through ERC-20 or ERC-721 contracts, which are literally contract templates.</li>
<li>The attack surface for smart contracts is reduced considerably, to the node software itself.</li>
<li>Bugs can be fixed for all contracts simultaneously by using a template versioning system. Existing assets can opt in
to fixes by migrating assets to a new version of the contract.</li>
<li>Contracts will have better Quality Assurance (QA), since more eyes are looking at fewer contract code sets.</li>
<li>Transmission, storage and processing of contracts will be more efficient, as one only has to deal with the parameters,
and not the logic of the contract. Furthermore, the cost for users is usually lower, since there's no need to add
friction or extra costs to contract execution (e.g. Ethereum gas) to work around the halting problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementation-1"><a class="header" href="#implementation-1">Implementation</a></h3>
<p>Assets are created on the Tari network by issuing a <code>create_asset</code> instruction from a wallet or client, and broadcasting
it to the Tari Digital Assets Network (DAN).</p>

<h4 id="issuer"><a class="header" href="#issuer">Issuer</a></h4>
<p>Anyone can create new assets on the Tari network from their Tari Collections client. The client will provide the Public Key Hash (PKH) and
sign the instruction. The client needn’t use the same private key each time.</p>
<h4 id="name-and-description"><a class="header" href="#name-and-description">Name and Description</a></h4>
<p>These fields are purely for information purposes. They do not need to be unique and do not act as an asset ID.</p>
<h4 id="raid-id"><a class="header" href="#raid-id">RAID ID</a></h4>
<p>The RAID_ID is a 15-character string that associates the asset issuer with a registered Internet domain name on the Domain Name System (DNS).</p>
<p>If it is likely that a digital asset issuer will be issuing many assets on the Tari Network (hundreds or thousands),
the issuer should strongly consider using a registered domain (e.g. <code>acme.com</code>). This is
done via OpenAlias on the domain owner's DNS record, as described in <a href="RFC-0301_NamespaceRegistration.html">RFC-0301</a>. A RAID prevents spoofing of assets from 
copycats or other malicious actors. It also simplifies asset discovery.</p>
<p>Assets from issuers that do not have a RAID are all grouped under the default RAID.</p>
<p>RAID owners must provide a valid signature proving that they own the given domain when creating assets.</p>
<h4 id="fully-qualified-domain-name"><a class="header" href="#fully-qualified-domain-name">Fully Qualified Domain Name</a></h4>
<p>The Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that corresponds to the <code>raid_id</code> or the string <code>&quot;NO FQDN&quot;</code> to use the default RAID ID.
Validator Nodes (VNs) will calculate and check that the RAID ID is valid when
<a href="RFC-0311_AssetTemplates.html#signature-validation">validating the instruction signature</a>.</p>
<h4 id="public-nonce"><a class="header" href="#public-nonce">Public Nonce</a></h4>
<p>A single-use public nonce to be used in the asset signature.</p>
<h4 id="asset-identification"><a class="header" href="#asset-identification">Asset Identification</a></h4>
<p>Assets are identified by a 64-character string that uniquely identifies an asset on the network:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Bytes</th><th align="left">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">8</td><td align="left">Template type (hex)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">Template version (hex)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">Feature flags (hex)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">15</td><td align="left">RAID identifier (Base58)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">A period character, <code>.</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">32</td><td align="left">Hex representation of the <code>metadata_hash</code> field</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This allows assets to be deterministically identified from their initial state. Two different creation instructions
leading to the same hash refer to the same single asset, by definition. VNs maintain an index of assets and
their committees, and so can determine whether a given asset already exists; and MUST reject any <code>create_asset</code>
instruction for an existing asset.</p>
<h4 id="template-id"><a class="header" href="#template-id">Template ID</a></h4>
<p>Tari uses templates to define the behaviour for its smart contracts. The template ID refers to the type of digital asset
being created.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Integer values are given in <em>little-endian</em> format, i.e. the least significant bit is <em>first</em>.</p>
<p>The template number is a 64-bit unsigned integer and has the following format, with 0 representing
the least significant bit:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Bit Range</th><th align="left">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">0 - 31</td><td align="left">Template type (0 - 4,294,967,295)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">32 - 47</td><td align="left">Template version (0 - 65,535)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">48</td><td align="left">Beta Mode flag</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">49</td><td align="left">Confidentiality flag</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">50 - 63</td><td align="left">Reserved (must be 0)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The lowest 32 bits refer to the canonical smart contract type, i.e. the qualitative types of contracts the network supports.
Many assets can be issued from a single template.</p>
<p>Template types below 65,536 (2<sup>16</sup>) are public, community-developed templates.
All VNs MUST implement and be able to interpret instructions related to these templates.</p>
<p>Template types 65,536 and above are opt-in or proprietary templates. There is no guarantee that any given VN
will be able to manage assets on these templates. Part of the committee selection and confirmation process for new
assets will be an attestation by VNs that they are willing and able to manage the asset under the designated
template rules.</p>
<p>A global registry of opt-in template types will be necessary to prevent collisions (public templates existence will be
evident from the Validator Node source code), possibly implemented as a special transaction type on the base layer, 
which is perfectly suited for hosting such a registry. The details of this will be covered in a separate
proposal.</p>
<p>Examples of template types may be:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Template Type</th><th align="left">Asset</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">Simple single-use tokens</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">Simple coupons</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">20</td><td align="left">ERC-20-compatible</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">...</td><td align="left">...</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">120</td><td align="left">Collectible cards</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">144</td><td align="left">In-game items</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">721</td><td align="left">ERC-721-compatible</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">...</td><td align="left">...</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">65,537</td><td align="left">Acme In game items</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">723,342</td><td align="left">CryptoKitties v8</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The template ID may also set one or more feature flags to indicate that the contract is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experimental, or in testing phase (bit 48).</li>
<li>Confidential. The definition of confidential assets and their implementation had not been finalized at the time of writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wallets/client apps SHOULD have settings to allow, or otherwise completely ignore, asset types on the network that have
certain feature flags enabled. For instance, most consumer wallets should never interact with templates that have the
“Beta mode” bit set. Only developers' wallets should ever even see that such assets exist.</p>
<h4 id="asset-expiry"><a class="header" href="#asset-expiry">Asset Expiry</a></h4>
<p>Asset issuers can set a future expiry date or block height, after which the asset will expire and nodes will be free to
expunge any/all state relating to the asset from memory after a fixed grace period. The grace period is to allow
interested parties (e.g. the issuer) to take a snapshot of the final state of the contract if they wish (e.g. proving
that you had a ticket for that epic World Cup final game, even after the asset no longer exists on the DAN).</p>
<p>Nodes will publish a final checkpoint on the base layer soon after expiry and before purging an asset.</p>
<p>The expiry_date is a Unix epoch, representing the number of seconds since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC if the value is
greater than 1,500,000,000; or a block height if it is less than that value (with 1 min blocks this scheme is valid
until the year 4870).</p>
<p>Expiry times should not be considered exact, since nodes don’t share the same clocks and block heights, and time proxies
become more inaccurate the further out you go (since height in the future is dependent on hash rate).</p>
<h3 id="signature-validation"><a class="header" href="#signature-validation">Signature Validation</a></h3>
<p>Validator nodes will verify the <code>creator_sig</code> for every <code>create_asset</code> instruction before propagating the instruction to
the network. The process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST calculate the metadata hash by hashing the canonical representation of all the data in the first three
sections of the <code>create_asset</code> instruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST compare this calculated value to the value given in the <code>metadata_hash</code> field. If they do not match, the 
VN MUST drop
the instruction and STOP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST calculate the RAID ID from the <code>fqdn</code> and <code>issuer</code> fields as specified in <a href="RFC-0301_NamespaceRegistration.html">RFC-0301</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST compare the calculated RAID ID with the value given in the <code>raid_id</code> field. If they do not match, the VN 
MUST drop
the instruction and STOP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the <code>fqdn</code> is `&quot;No FQDN&quot;, then skip to step 9.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST Look up the OpenAlias TXT record at the domain given in <code>fqdn</code>. If the record  does not exist, then the 
VN MUST
drop the instruction and STOP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST check that each of the public key and RAID ID in the TXT record match the values in the <code>create_asset</code>
instruction. If any values do not match, the VN MUST then drop the instruction and STOP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST validate the registration signature in the TXT record, using the TXT record's nonce, the issuer's public
key and the RAID ID. If the signature does not verify, the VN MUST drop the instruction and STOP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST validate the signature in the <code>creator_sig</code> field against the challenge built up from the issuer's public
key, the nonce given in <code>public_nonce</code> field, the <code>raid_id</code> field and the <code>metadata_hash</code> field.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If step 9 passes, then the VN has proven that the <code>create_asset</code> contains a valid RAID ID, and that if a non-default
FQDN was provided, the owner of that domain provided the <code>create_asset</code> instruction. In this case, the VN SHOULD
propagate the instruction to the network.</p>

<p>Tari digital assets are created on the <a href="RFC-0300_DAN.html">Digital Assets Network</a>, managed by a Validator Node (VN)
committee, see <a href="RFC-0340_VNConsensusOverview.html">RFC-0340</a>, and are operated under the rules of the
<a href="RFC-0311_AssetTemplates.html">template</a> that governs the asset.</p>
<p>A <em>given version</em> of a template provides an immutable definition of the type of information (the state) that is managed
during the lifetime of the asset. <em>All</em> the rules that govern reading and updating of the asset state, and rules
regarding any transfers of tokens that may be defined as part of the asset are governed by the template code.</p>
<p>This immutability is what allows VN committees to reach rapid consensus about what an asset’s state looks<br />
like after <a href="Glossary.html#instructions">instructions</a> are executed.</p>
<p>However, immutability is a major problem when faced with typical software and business development challenges such as
software bugs, or changes in legal and operational requirements.</p>
<p>The Tari network is designed to accommodate these requirements by offering a migration path for assets from one version
of a template to another version of a template.</p>
<h3 id="asset-migration"><a class="header" href="#asset-migration">Asset migration</a></h3>
<p>To carry out a successful migration, the following requirements must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The validator node committee for the asset must support the migration path. This entails that <em>every</em> VN in the
committee has a <code>MigrateAsset</code> class from the <code>template_type.version</code> combination of the existing asset to the
<code>template_type.version</code> of the new asset.</li>
<li>The original asset issuer provides a valid <code>migrate_asset</code> instruction to the DAN.
<ul>
<li>The asset issuer MUST provide any additional state that exists in the new template version and not the original.</li>
<li>The original asset SHOULD be marked as <code>retired</code>. If so, the <code>superseded_by</code> field in the old asset will carry the
new asset id once the new asset has been confirmed. We recommend retiring the old asset because all the keys that
indicate ownership of tokens will be copied over; effectively re-using them; which can damage privacy.</li>
<li>A policy is provided to determine the course of action to follow if any state from the old asset is illegal under
the new template rules (e.g. If a new rule requires <code>token.age</code> to be &gt; 21; what happens to any tokens where this
condition fails?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the migration,</p>
<ol>
<li>An entirely new asset is created with the full state of the old asset copied over into the new asset; supplemented
with any additional state required in the new template.</li>
<li>A state validation run is performed; and any invalid state from the old asset is modified according to the migration
policy.</li>
<li>Step 2 is repeated until a valid initial state is produced.</li>
<li>If Step 2 has run <code>STATE_VALIDATION_LIMIT</code> times and the initial state is still not valid, the migration instruction
is rejected; the migrate_asset instruction will advise what should be done with the original asset in this case:
either allow the original asset to continue as before, or retire it.</li>
<li>Once a valid initial state is produced, a new <code>create_asset</code> instruction is generated from the initial
state and the <code>migrate_asset</code> instruction. Typically the same VN committee will be used for the new asset, but this
needn’t be the case.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a successful migration has completed, any instructions to the old asset can return a simple <code>asset_migrated</code>
response with the new asset ID, which will allow clients and wallets to seamlessly update their records.</p>
<h3 id="retiring-assets"><a class="header" href="#retiring-assets">Retiring Assets</a></h3>
<p>Retiring an asset follows the same procedure as when as asset reaches its natural end-of-life: A final checkpoint is
posted to the base layer and a grace period is given to allow DAN nodes and clients to take a snapshot of the final
state if desired.</p>
<h3 id="resurrecting-assets"><a class="header" href="#resurrecting-assets">Resurrecting assets</a></h3>
<p>It’s unreasonable to expect VNs to hold onto large chunks of state for assets that are effectively dead (e.g. ticket
stubs long after the event is over). For this reason, assets are allowed to expire after which VNs can forget about the
state and use that storage for something else.</p>
<p>However, it may be that interest in an asset resurfaces long after the asset expires (nostalgia being the multi-billion
dollar industry it is today). The <code>resurrect_asset</code> instruction provides a mechanism to bring an asset back to life.</p>
<p>To resurrect an asset, the following conditions must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The asset must have expired.</li>
<li>It must not be currently active (i.e. it hasn’t already been resurrected).</li>
<li>An asset issuer (not necessarily the original asset issuer) must provide funding for the new lifetime of the asset.</li>
<li>The asset issuer needs to have a copy of the state corresponding to the final asset checkpoint of the original asset.</li>
<li>The new asset issuer transmits a <code>resurrect_asset</code> instruction to the network. This instruction is identical to the
original <code>create_asset</code> instruction with the following exceptions:
<ul>
<li>The “initial state” merkle root must be equal to the final state checkpoint merkle root.</li>
<li>The asset owner public key will be provided by the new asset issuer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Third parties can interrogate the new committee asking them to provide a Merkle Proof for pieces of state that the
third party (perhaps former asset owners) knows about. This can mitigate fraud attempts where parties can attempt to
resurrect assets without actually having a copy of the smart contract state. If enough random state proofs are
requested, or a single proof of enough random pieces of state, we can be confident that the asset resurrection is
legitimate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The VN committee for the resurrected asset need not bear any relation to the original VN committee.
Once confirmed, the resurrected asset operates exactly like any other asset.
An asset can expire and be resurrected multiple times (sequentially).</p>

<h3 id="overview-3"><a class="header" href="#overview-3">Overview</a></h3>
<p>The primary problem under consideration here is for multiple machines running the same program (in the form of a Tari
smart contract) to maintain agreement on what the state of the program is, often under adverse conditions, including
unreliable network communication, malicious third parties, or even malicious peers running the smart contract.</p>
<p>In computer science terms, the problem is referred to as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication">State Machine Replication</a>, or SMR. If we want our honest
machines (referred to as <em>replicas</em> in SMR parlance) to reach agreement in the face of arbitrary failures, then we talk
about our system being
<a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/consensus-mechanisms/BFT-consensusmechanisms/sources/PITCHME.link.html">Byzantine Fault Tolerant</a>.</p>
<p>Tari Asset <a href="Glossary.html#committee">committees</a> are chosen by the asset issuer according to <a href="RFC-0304_VNCommittees.html">RFC-0304</a>. The committees
form a fixed set of replicas, at the very least from checkpoint to checkpoint, and will typically be limited in size,
usually less than ten, and almost always under 100. <em>Note</em>: These numbers are highly speculative based on an intuitive
guess about the main use cases for Tari DAs, where we have</p>
<ul>
<li>many 1-3-sized committees where the asset issuer and the VN committee are the same entity,</li>
<li>semi-decentralised assets of ±4-10 where speed trumps censorship-resistance,</li>
<li>a small number of 50-100 VNs where censorship-resistance trumps speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because nodes cannot join and leave the committees at will, robust yet slow and expensive consensus approaches such as
Nakamoto consensus can be dropped in favour of something more performant.</p>
<p>There is a good survey of consensus mechanisms on
<a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/consensus-mechanisms/consensus-mechanisms.html">Tari Labs University</a>.</p>
<p>From the point of view of a DAN committee, the ideal consensus algorithm is one that</p>
<ol>
<li>Allows a high number of transactions per second, and doesn't have unnecessary pauses (i.e. a partially synchronous or
asynchronous model).</li>
<li>Is Byzantine Fault tolerant.</li>
<li>Is relatively efficient from a network communication point of view (number of messages passed per state agreement).</li>
<li>Is relatively simple to implement (to reduce the bug and vulnerability surface in implementations).</li>
</ol>
<p>A summary of some of the most well-known BFT algorithms is presented in
<a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/consensus-mechanisms/BFT-consensus-mechanisms-applications/MainReport.html#summary-of-findings">this table</a>.</p>
<p>A close reading of the algorithms presented suggest that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01829.pdf">LinBFT</a>, which is based
on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a> BFT provide the best trade-offs for the goals that a DAN committee is trying to achieve:</p>
<ol>
<li>The algorithm is optimistic, i.e. as soon as quorum is reached on a particular state, the committee can move onto the
next one. There is no need to wait for the &quot;timeout&quot; period as we do in e.g. Tendermint. This allows instructions to
be executed almost as quickly as they are received.</li>
<li>The algorithm is efficient in communication, requiring O(n) messages per state agreement in most practical cases.
This is compared to e.g. PBFT which requires O(n<sup>4</sup>) messages.</li>
<li>The algorithm is modular and relatively simple to implement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Potential drawbacks to using HotStuff include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each round required the election of a <em>leader</em>. Having a leader dramatically simplifies the consensus algorithm; it
allows a linear number of messages to be sent between the leader and the other replicas in order to agree on the
current state; and it allows a strict ordering to be established on instructions without having to resort to e.g.
proof of work. However, if the choice of leader is deterministic, attackers can identify and potentially DDOS the
leader for a given round, causing the algorithm to time out. There are ways to mitigate this attack for a <em>specific
round</em>, as suggested in the LinBFT paper, such as using Verifiable Random Functions, but DDOSing a single replica
means that, on average, the algorithm will time out every 1/n rounds.</li>
<li>The attack described above only pauses progress in Hotstuff for the timeout period. In similar protocols, e.g.
Tendermint it can be shown to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069">delay progress indefinitely</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given these trade-offs, there is strong evidence to suggest that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a> BFT, when implemented on the Tari DAN will
provide BFT security guarantees with liveness performance in the sub-second scale and throughput on the order of
thousands of instructions per second, if the benchmarks presented in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a> paper are representative.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-2"><a class="header" href="#implementation-2">Implementation</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a> BFT algorithm provides a detailed description of the consensus algorithm. Only a summary of it is
presented here. To reduce confusion, we adopt the HotStuff nomenclature to describe state changes, rounds and function
names where appropriate.</p>
<p>Every proposed state change, as a result of replicas receiving instructions from clients is called a <em>view</em>. There is a
<a href="RFC-0340_VNConsensusOverview.html#leader-selection">function that every node can call</a> that will tell it which replica will be the <em>leader</em> for a given
view. Every view goes through three phases (<code>Prepare</code>, <code>PreCommit</code>, <code>Commit</code>) before final consensus is reached. Once a
view reaches the <code>Commit</code> phase, it is finalised and will never be reversed.</p>
<p>As part of their normal operation, every replica broadcasts <a href="Glossary.html#instructions">instructions</a> it receives for its contract to its peers.
These instructions are stored in a replica's instruction mempool.</p>
<p>When the <a href="RFC-0340_VNConsensusOverview.html#leader-selection">leader selection</a> function designates a replica as leader for the next view, it will try
and execute <em>all</em> the instructions it currently has in its mempool to update the state for the next view. Following this
it compiles a tuple of &lt;<em>valid-instructions</em>, <em>rejected-instructions</em>, <em>new-state</em>&gt;. This tuple represents the <code>CMD</code>
structure described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a>.</p>
<p>In parallel with this, the leader expects a set of <code>NewView</code> messages from the other replicas, indicating that the other
replicas know that this replica is the leader for the next view.</p>
<p>Once a super-majority of these messages have been received, the leader composes a proposal for the next state by adding
a new node to the state history graph (I'm calling it a state history graph to avoid naming confusion, but it's really a
blockchain). It composes a message containing the new proposal, and broadcasts it to the other replicas.</p>
<p>Replicas, on receipt of the proposal, decide whether the proposal is valid, both from a protocol point of view (i.e. did
the leader provide a well-formed proposal) as well as whether they agree on the new state (e.g. by executing the
instructions as given and comparing the resulting state with that of the proposal). If there is agreement, they vote on
the proposal by signing it, and sending their partial signature back to the leader.</p>
<p>When the leader has received a super-majority of votes, it sends a message back to the replicas with the (aggregated)
set of signatures.</p>
<p>Replicas can validate this signature and provide another partial signature indicating that they've received the first
aggregated signature for the proposal.</p>
<p>At this point, all replicas know that enough other replicas have received the proposal and are in agreement that it is
valid.</p>
<p>In Tendermint, replicas would now wait for the timeout period to make sure that the proposal wasn't going to be
superseded before finalising the proposal. But there is an attack described in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a> paper that could stall
progress at this point.</p>
<p>The HotStuff protocol prevents this by having a final round of confirmations with the leader. This prevents the stalling
attack and <em>also</em> lets replicas finalise the proposal <em>immediately</em> on receipt of the final confirmation from the
leader. This lets HotStuff proceed at &quot;network&quot; speed, rather than with a heartbeat dictated by the BFT synchronicity
parameter.</p>
<p>Although there are 4 round trips of communication between replicas and the leader, the number of messages sent are O(n).
It's also possible to stagger and layer these rounds on top of each other, so that there are always four voting rounds
happening simultaneously, rather than waiting for one to complete in its entirety before moving onto the next one.
Further details are given in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a> paper.</p>
<h4 id="forks-and-byzantine-failures"><a class="header" href="#forks-and-byzantine-failures">Forks and byzantine failures</a></h4>
<p>The summary of the HotStuff protocol given above describes the &quot;Happy Path&quot;, when there are no breakdowns in
communication, or when the leader is an honest node. In cases where the leader is unavailable, the protocol will time
out, the current view will be abandoned, and all replicas will move onto the next view.</p>
<p>If a leader is not honest, replicas will reject its proposal, and move onto the next view.</p>
<p>If there is a temporary network partition, the chain may fork (up to a depth of three), but the protocol guarantees
safety via the voting mechanism, and the chain will reconcile once the partition resolves.</p>
<h4 id="leader-selection"><a class="header" href="#leader-selection">Leader selection</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a> leaves the leader selection algorithm to the application. Usually, a round-robin approach is suggested for
its simplicity. However, this requires the replicas to <em>reliably</em> self-order themselves before starting with SMR, which
is a non-trivial exercise in byzantine conditions.</p>
<p>For Tari DAN committees, the following algorithm is proposed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every replica knows the <a href="Glossary.html#node-id">Node ID</a> of every other replica in the committee.</li>
<li>For a given <em>view number</em>, the Node ID with the closest XOR distance to the hash of the <em>view number</em> will be the
leader for that view, where the hash function provides a uniformly random value of the same length as the Node ID.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="quorum-certificate"><a class="header" href="#quorum-certificate">Quorum Certificate</a></h4>
<p>A Quorum certificate, or QC is proof that a super-majority of replicas have agreed on a given state. In particular, a QC
consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>The type of QC (depending on the phase in which the HotStuff pipeline the QC was signed),</li>
<li>The <em>view number</em> for the QC</li>
<li>A reference to the node in the state tree being ratified,</li>
<li>A signature from a super-majority of replicas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tari-specific-considerations"><a class="header" href="#tari-specific-considerations">Tari-specific considerations</a></h3>
<p>As soon as a state is finalised, replicas can inform clients as to the result of instructions they have submitted (in
the affirmative or negative). Given that HotStuff proceeds optimistically, and finalisation happens after 4 rounds of
communication, it's anticipated that clients can receive a final response from the validator committee in under 500 ms
for reasonably-sized committees (this value is speculation at present and will be updated once exploratory experiments
have been carried out).</p>
<p>The Tari communication platform was designed to handle peer-to-peer messaging of the type described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a>, and
therefore the protocol implementation should be relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>The &quot;state&quot; agreed upon by the VN committee will not only include the smart-contract state, but instruction fee
allocations and periodic checkpoints onto the base layer.</p>
<p>Checkpoints onto the base layer achieve several goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offers a proof-of-work backstop against &quot;evil committees&quot;. Without proof of work, there's nothing stopping an evil
committee (one that controls a super-majority of replicas) from rewriting history. Proof-of-work is the only reliable
and practical method that currently exists to make it expensive to change the history of a chain of records. Tari
gives us a &quot;best of both worlds&quot; scenario wherein an evil committee would have to rewrite the base layer history
(which <em>does</em> use proof-of-work) before they could rewrite the digital asset history (which does not).</li>
<li>They allow the asset issuer to authorise changes in the VN committee replica set.</li>
<li>It allows asset owners to have an immutable proof of asset ownership long after the VN committee has dissolved after
the useful end-of-life of a smart contract.</li>
<li>Provides a means for an asset issuer to resurrect a smart contract long after the original contract has terminated.</li>
</ul>
<p>When Validator Nodes run smart contracts, they should be run in a separate thread so that if a smart contract crashes,
it does not bring the consensus algorithm down with it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, VNs should be able to quickly revert state to at least four views back in order to handle temporary forks.
Nodes should also be able to initialise/resume a smart contract (e.g. from a crash) given a state, view number, and view
history.</p>
<p>This implies that VNs, in addition to passing around HotStuff BFT messages, will expose additional APIs in order to</p>
<ul>
<li>allow lagging replicas to catch up in the execution state.</li>
<li>Provide information to (authorised) clients regarding the most recent finalised state of the smart contract via a
read-only API.</li>
<li>Accept smart-contract instructions from clients and forward these onto the other replicas in the VN committee.</li>

<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe a formulation of a <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a> <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> negotiation process
to allow for the sale of an <a href="Glossary.html#nft">Non Fungible Token</a> (NFT) by a Seller to a Buyer. The Seller will initiate the transaction negotiation by
specifying which [NFT] containing <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a> they are offering for sale and how much Tari they expect in return. Having the party
that will receive the funds specify the funds they wish to receive is termed an Invoice. The Buyer will then provide their payment 
input and resulting change output to the transaction and provide a partial signature. The final step will be the Seller 
completing the final signature to produce a complete transaction.</p>
<p>The process must be completely atomic. At no point should the data included in the negotiation be malleable by the other party
or allow for one party to change the elements provided by the counterparty without making the transaction invalid.</p>

<h2 id="description-27"><a class="header" href="#description-27">Description</a></h2>
<p>The standard interactive <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a> transaction is usually initiated by a party, the Sender, that is going to send 
funds to a Receiver. The Sender selects a number of input UTXOs from which the sent funds and fees will come from, they
build a change UTXO to receive any remaining funds and calculate the excess of these inputs and change output. The 
Receiver is then told how many Tari they will receive and provides the aggregated public excess and public nonce of the 
Sender's portion of the transaction signature. The Receiver builds a commitment with the specified value and their 
private spending key and then provides their partial signature for their UTXO and the excess. This gets sent back to the 
Sender who then completes the transaction by providing their partial signature and aggregating it with the Receiver's 
partial signature.</p>
<p>In the standard Mimblewimble negotiation there are two main elements that make the process trustless for the Sender and
Receiver. Firstly, for the Sender, whose inputs are being spent, has the final say in whether to complete the transaction
by producing the final signature. For the Receiver there is little risk because they have not provided any inputs at all
and are just receiving funds, so they have nothing to lose if the process is compromised. Furthermore, their partial signature
means that the Sender cannot change anything about the Receiver's output in the final stage of negotiation.</p>
<p>When it comes to the sale of a token using a <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a> style transaction the risk profile for both the Seller and the
Buyer is a bit more complicated.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Seller has to prove that they own a given token UTXO and provide some partial signature committing to the terms of 
the sale without the Buyer being able to use that data to build a new transaction transferring ownership of the token
with different terms to what the Seller specified.</li>
<li>The Buyer has to provide inputs into the transaction before the finalization step in such a way that those inputs are 
committed but not at risk of the Seller being able to claim the inputs without completing the agreed upon transaction in full.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the ultimate goal must be a negotiation process where the Seller and Buyer can interact completely trustlessly to build
this transaction to the agreed terms. This must be done while each party's contributions to the negotiation are not 
malleable by the other party and the entire process must be atomic. It either results in a valid transaction built as both
parties expect or not at all.</p>

<h3 id="assumptions-4"><a class="header" href="#assumptions-4">Assumptions:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The UTXOs containing the token data have a value of zero (This has not been decided yet in the RFCs regarding token UTXOs).</li>
<li>The Buyer is going to pay the fees.</li>
<li>The Buyer will select a single input for payment purposes whose value will cover the requested payment and fees.</li>
<li>In the following notation a Transaction Input/Output will be represented by \( C_x \) and when used in equations
will represent a Pederson Commitment but when sent to the counterparty will include all the addition metadata as described in
<a href="RFC-0201_TariScript.html">RFC-0201: TariScript</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the following equations the capital letter subscripts, <em>S</em> and <em>B</em> refer to a token <em>Seller</em> and <em>Buyer</em> respectively.</p>
<p>The transaction that is constructed by this process will need to produce an output <a href="Glossary.html#metadata-signature">metadata signature</a> for the Transaction Output
the Buyer will receive the token in and also the Transaction Output the Seller will receive their payment in. These signatures
will be aggregated <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/061.pdf">Commitment Signature</a>s that are described in detail in <a href="RFC-0201_TariScript.html">RFC-0201: TariScript</a>.</p>
<p><a href="RFC-0201_TariScript.html">RFC-0201: TariScript</a> is written from the perspective of a standard Mimblewimble transaction where
only the Sender has Transaction Inputs and the Receiver only has a single Transaction Output. The case this RFC discusses 
both parties receive a Transaction Output and both parties supply a Transaction Input. This results in the requirement of an
extra round of communication between the parties. However, the negotiation described below allows for a transaction to be 
built that can be validated exactly the same was as is described in <a href="RFC-0201_TariScript.html">RFC-0201: TariScript</a>.</p>

<p>The commitment signature is provided to the Buyer to show that the Seller does indeed own the token UTXO \( C_{St} \). 
The Buyer's wallet should verify on the base layer that this UTXO is for the token they are being offered.</p>
<p>The Buyer will construct the Seller's public Excess, \( X_s \) from the provided components:
\( X_s = C_{Sp} - C_{St} - v_p \cdot H \)
This operation confirms that the only commitments that form part of the Seller's excess are the token input and a commitment 
with the value of the requested payment. To ensure that there is no malleability in the Seller's payment output the Buyer

<p>The Buyer's change Transaction Output will be constructed fully by them including the <a href="Glossary.html#metadata-signature">metadata signature</a> which will be included in the final \( \gamma \) value.</p>
<h3 id="validation"><a class="header" href="#validation">Validation</a></h3>
<p>A <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">Base Node</a> will validate this transaction in the exact same way as described in <a href="RFC-0201_TariScript.html">RFC-0201: TariScript</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard Mimblewimble and TariScript validation operations the consensus rules required for assets and
tokens must also be applied. The most important is to confirm that the <code>unique_id</code> of the token being sold in this transaction
exists only once as an input and once as an output and the metadata is correctly transfered.</p>
<h3 id="security-concerns"><a class="header" href="#security-concerns">Security concerns</a></h3>
<p>For this negotiation to be secure it must not be possible for the following to occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>For the Buyer to use the information provided by the Seller during the first round to construct a valid transaction 
spending the Seller's token UTXO without the requested payment being fulfilled.</li>
<li>For the Seller to take the information provided by the Buyer in the second round and construct a valid transaction 
where the ownership of the token is not transferred even if the Mimblewimble arithmetic balances out.</li>
</ol>
<p>These points should both be taken care of by the aggregated excess signature and the respective output [metadata signatures]. 
These signatures prevent the counterparty from changing anything about the Transaction Outputs without the cooperation of the
other party.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-7"><a class="header" href="#introduction-7">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>The base layer is slow. The DAN is fast. However, every DAN instruction that results in a state change has a fee (i.e.
base layer transaction) associated with it.<br />
To bridge the speed gap between the two layers, a payment channel solution is required.<br />
This document provides the high-level overview of how this is done.</p>
<h3 id="the-clacks"><a class="header" href="#the-clacks">The Clacks</a></h3>
<p>The Clacks is a multi-party side-channel off-chain scalability proposal for Tari. The essential idea behind the Clacks
is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users give control of some Tari to a Clacks Committee.</li>
<li>The committee creates an off-chain UTXO for the user(s). This is called the peg-in transaction.</li>
<li>Users can transact amongst each other without those transactions touching the base layer. This allows a very high
throughput of transactions and instant finality. However, the locus of trust move significantly towards the Clacks
committee. In other words, base layer transactions are slow, but do not require users to trust anyone. Clacks
transactions are fast, but requires some level of trust in the entity or entities controlling the user's funds.</li>
<li>Users can send off-chain Tari to any other users, including users that have not made deposits into the Clacks
committee.</li>
<li>Users can request a withdrawal for their Tari at any time. At predefined intervals, the Clacks committee will process
those withdrawal requests and give the Tari UTXO control back to the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users also have a pre-signed, time-locked transaction that returns the user's fund back to them. This refund transaction
can be used in case the Clacks committee stops processing withdrawals and provides insurance for users against having
their funds locked up forever.</p>
<p>The peg-in, peg-out cycle are represented by standard Tari transactions. This means that full nodes verify that no funds
have been created or destroyed over the course of the cycle. They do not check that the &quot;balances&quot; associated with users
are what those users would expect in an honestly run side chain.</p>
<p>However, if the side-chain is run as a standard mimblewimble process, any third party running a full node and that
access to the opening and closing channel balances, can in fact verify that the committee has operated honestly.</p>

<li>Digital assets can be attribute(s) of another digital asset, e.g. wheels of a vehicle or a VIP ticket has two drink 
cards.</li>
<li>Digital assets can have contingencies, e.g. ownership of a digital asset is contingent on ownership of a different 
digital asset. Using this digital asset is contingent on holding it for a particular duration, etc.</li>
<li>Digital assets can have utility, e.g. be useful.</li>
<li>Digital assets can be used across platforms, e.g. a digital asset for a game could be used as avatars in a social

<h3 id="rules"><a class="header" href="#rules">Rules</a></h3>
<p>Rules are the governance of how digital assets may be used or transferred, as defined by the asset issuer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Royalty fees.  Digital asset issuers can set a royalty that charges a fee every time the digital asset is transferred 
between parties. The fee as defined by the issuer can be fixed or dynamic, or follow a complex formula, and value is 
granted to the issuer(s) and/or other entities.</li>
<li>Contingency. Digital asset ownership/interaction may be contingent/dependent on another asset.</li>
<li>Timing controls. Digital assets can only be transferred or used at particular times.</li>

Worker</a>s. Mining Servers are responsible for constructing new blocks by bundling transactions from the <a href="Glossary.html#mempool">mempool</a> 
of a connected Base Node. They then distribute Proof-of-Work (PoW) tasks to Mining Workers in an attempt to solve 
newly created blocks. Solved solutions and shares are sent by the Mining Workers to the Mining Server, which in turn 
verifies the solution and distributes the newly created blocks to the Base Node and Monero Node for inclusion in 
their respective blockchains.</p>
<h3 id="merged-mining-on-tari-base-layer"><a class="header" href="#merged-mining-on-tari-base-layer">Merged Mining on Tari Base Layer</a></h3>

<h4 id="overview-of-tari-merged-mining-process-using-mining-servers-and-mining-workers"><a class="header" href="#overview-of-tari-merged-mining-process-using-mining-servers-and-mining-workers">Overview of Tari Merged Mining Process using Mining Servers and Mining Workers</a></h4>
<p>Mining on the Tari Base Layer consists of three primary entities: the Base Nodes, Mining Servers and Mining Workers. 
A description of the Base Node is provided in <a href="https://tari-project.github.io/tari/RFC-0110_BaseNodes.html">RFC-0110/Base Nodes</a>.
A Mining Server is connected locally or remotely to a Tari Base Node and a Monero Node, and is responsible for 
constructing Tari and Monero Blocks from their respective mempools. The Mining Server should retrieve transactions 
from the mempool of the connected Base Node and assemble a new Tari block by bundling transactions together.</p>
<p>Mining servers may re-verify transactions before including them in a new Tari block, but this enforcement of 
verification and transaction rules such as signatures and timelocks is the responsibility of the connected Base Node. 
Mining Servers are responsible for <a href="Glossary.html#cut-through">cut-through</a>, as this is required for scalability and privacy.</p>
<p>To enable merged mining of Tari with Monero, both a Tari and a Monero block need to be created and linked. First, 
a new Tari block is created and then the block header hash of the new Tari block is included in the coinbase 
transaction of the new Monero block. Once a new merged mined Monero block has been constructed, PoW tasks can 
be sent to the connected Mining Workers, which will attempt to solve the block by performing the latest released 
version of the PoW algorithm selected by Monero.</p>
<p>Assuming the Tari difficulty is less than the Monero difficulty, miners get rewarded for solving the PoW at any 
difficulty above the Tari difficulty. If the block is solved above the Tari difficulty, a new Tari block is mined. 
If the difficulty is also greater than the Monero difficulty, a new Monero block is mined as well. In either event, 
the header for the candidate Monero block is included in the Tari block header.</p>
<p>If the PoW solution was sufficient to meet the difficult level of both the Tari and Monero blockchains, then the 
individual blocks for each blockchain can be sent from the Mining Server to the Base Node and Monero Node to be 
added to the respective blockchains.</p>
<p>Every Tari block must include the solved Monero block's information (block header hash, Merkle tree branch and 
hash of the coinbase transaction) in the PoW summary section of the Tari block header. 
If the PoW solution found by the Mining Workers only solved the problem at the Tari difficulty, the Monero block can be discarded. </p>
<p>This process will ensure that the Tari difficulty remains independent. Adjusting the difficulty will ensure that 
the Tari block times are preserved. Also, the Tari block time can be less than, equal to or greater than the Monero block 
times. A more detailed description of the merged mining process between a Primary and Auxiliary blockchain is provided 
in the <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/merged-mining/merged-mining.html">Merged Mining TLU report</a>.</p>

<a href="Glossary.html#committee" title="A group of validator nodes that are responsible for managing a specific Digital Asset">committee</a>.</p>
<h2 id="asset-issuer"><a class="header" href="#asset-issuer">Asset Issuer</a></h2>
<p>An entity that creates digital assets on the Tari DAN. The Asset Issuer will specify the parameters of the contract
template that defines the rules that govern the asset and the number and nature of its constituent tokens on issuance.
The Asset Issuer will, generally, be the initial owner of the tokens.</p>
<h2 id="bad-actor"><a class="header" href="#bad-actor">Bad Actor</a></h2>
<p>A participant that acts maliciously or negligently to the detriment of the network or another participant.</p>
<h2 id="base-layer-1"><a class="header" href="#base-layer-1">Base layer</a></h2>
<p>The Tari Base layer is a merge-mined <a href="Glossary.html#blockchain" title="The linked sequence of Tari blocks on the Tari base layer">blockchain</a> secured by proof-of-work. The base layer is primarily responsible for
the emission of new Tari, for securing and managing <a href="Glossary.html#tari-coin" title="The base layer token">Tari coin</a> transfers.</p>
<h2 id="base-node"><a class="header" href="#base-node">Base Node</a></h2>
<p>A full Tari node running on the base layer. It's primary role is validating and propagating <a href="Glossary.html#tari-coin" title="The base layer token">Tari coin</a> transactions
and blocks to the rest of the network.</p>
<h2 id="block"><a class="header" href="#block">Block</a></h2>
<p>A collection of transactions and associated metadata recorded as a single entity in the Tari blockchain. The ordering of
Tari transactions is set purely by the block height of the block they are recorded in.</p>

<h2 id="chain-reorganization"><a class="header" href="#chain-reorganization">Chain Reorganization</a></h2>
<p>A chain reorganization occurs after a chain split occurs on the network, which commonly occurs due to network latency
and connectivity issues. When a chain split occurs one chain will have the higher accumulated proof-of-work, this chain
is considered the best chain. Nodes on the poorer chain will need to rewind and resync their chains to best chain. In 
this process transaction in the mempool could become orphaned or invalid.</p>
<h2 id="checkpoint"><a class="header" href="#checkpoint">Checkpoint</a></h2>

on a given Digital Asset.</p>
<h2 id="commitment"><a class="header" href="#commitment">Commitment</a></h2>
<p>A commitment is a cryptographic primitive that allows one to commit to a chosen value while keeping it hidden from
others, with the ability to reveal the committed value later. Commitments are designed so that one cannot change the
value or statement after they have committed to it.</p>
<h2 id="communication-node"><a class="header" href="#communication-node">Communication Node</a></h2>
<p>A Communication Node is either a Validator Node or Base Node that is part of the Tari communication network. It

<h2 id="creator-nomination-mode"><a class="header" href="#creator-nomination-mode">Creator Nomination Mode</a></h2>
<p>An asset runs in creator nomination mode when <em>every</em> validator node in a validator committee is a <a href="Glossary.html#trusted-node" title="A permissioned Validator Node nominated by an Asset Issuer">Trusted Node</a> that
was directly nominated by the <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer" title="An entity that creates digital assets on the Tari DAN">Asset Issuer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="current-head"><a class="header" href="#current-head">Current head</a></h2>
<p>The last <a href="Glossary.html#block" title="A collection of transactions and associated metadata recorded as a single entity in the Tari blockchain">block</a> of the base layer that represents the latest valid block. This <a href="Glossary.html#block" title="A collection of transactions and associated metadata recorded as a single entity in the Tari blockchain">block</a> must be from the longest
proof-of-work chain to be the current head.</p>
<h2 id="cut-through-2"><a class="header" href="#cut-through-2">Cut-Through</a></h2>
<p>Cut-through is the process where outputs spent within a single block may be removed without breaking the standard <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">MimbleWimble</a>
validation rules. Simplistically, <code>Alice -&gt; Bob -&gt; Carol</code> may be &quot;cut-through&quot; to <code>Alice -&gt; Carol</code>. Bob's commitments may be removed.</p>
<p>On Tari, for reasons described in <a href="./RFC-0201_TariScript.html#utxo-data-commitments">RFC-0201_TariScript</a>, cut-through is prevented from ever happening.</p>
<h2 id="digital-asset"><a class="header" href="#digital-asset">Digital asset</a></h2>
<p>Digital assets (DAs) are the sets or collections of native digital tokens (both fungible and non-fungible) that are
created by <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer" title="An entity that creates digital assets on the Tari DAN">asset issuer</a>s on the Tari 2nd layer. For example, a promoter might create a DA for a music concert event.
The event is the digital asset, and the tickets for the event are digital asset <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset-tokens" title="or just, &quot;tokens&quot;. The tokens associated with a given digital asset. Tokens are created
 by asset issuers">tokens</a>.</p>
<h2 id="digital-asset-network"><a class="header" href="#digital-asset-network">Digital Asset Network</a></h2>
<p>The Tari second layer. All digital asset interactions are managed on the Tari Digital Assets Network (DAN). These
interactions (defined in <a href="Glossary.html#instructions" title="Second-layer network commands for managing digital asset state">instruction</a>s) are processed and validated by <a href="Glossary.html#validator-node" title="A second-layer node that manages and validates digital asset state transitions">Validator Node</a>s.</p>
<h2 id="digitalassettemplate"><a class="header" href="#digitalassettemplate">DigitalAssetTemplate</a></h2>
<p>A DigitalAssetTemplate is one of a set of contract types supported by the DAN. These contracts are non-turing complete
and consist of rigid rule-sets with parameters that can be set by Asset Issuers.</p>
<h2 id="digital-asset-tokens"><a class="header" href="#digital-asset-tokens">Digital asset tokens</a></h2>
<p>Digital asset tokens (or often, just &quot;tokens&quot;) are the finite set of digital entities associated with a given digital
asset. Depending on the DA created, tokens can represent tickets, in-game items, collectibles or loyalty points. They
are bound to the <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset" title="Sets of Native digital tokens, both fungible and non-fungible that are created by
asset issuers on the Tari 2nd layer">digital asset</a> that created them.</p>

<p>Instructions are the <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset-network" title="The Tari second layer. All digital asset interactions are managed here.">digital asset network</a> equivalent of <a href="Glossary.html#transaction" title="Base layer tari coin transfers.">transaction</a>s. Instructions are issued by asset issuers and
client applications and are relayed by the DAN to the <a href="Glossary.html#validator-node" title="A second-layer node that manages and validates digital asset state transitions">validator node</a>s that are managing the associated
<a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset" title="Sets of Native digital tokens, both fungible and non-fungible that are created by
asset issuers on the Tari 2nd layer">digital asset</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mempool-2"><a class="header" href="#mempool-2">Mempool</a></h2>
<p>The mempool consists of the transaction pool, pending pool, orphan pool and reorg pool, and is responsible for managing
unconfirmed transactions that have not yet been included in the longest proof-of-work chain. Miners usually draw
verified transactions from the mempool to build up transaction <a href="Glossary.html#block" title="A collection of transactions and associated metadata recorded as a single entity in the Tari blockchain">block</a>s.</p>
<h2 id="metadata-signature"><a class="header" href="#metadata-signature">Metadata Signature</a></h2>
<p>The metadata signature is an aggregated Commitment Signature (&quot;ComSig&quot;) signature, attached to a transaction output and
signed with a combination of the homomorphic commitment private values \( (v_i \, , \, k_i )\), the spending key
known only to the receiver, and sender offset private key \(k_{Oi}\) known only to the sender. This prevents
malleability of the UTXO metadata.</p>
<h2 id="mimblewimble"><a class="header" href="#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a></h2>
<p>Mimblewimble is a privacy-centric cryptocurrency protocol. It was
<a href="https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/wizardry/mimblewimble.txt">dropped</a> in the Bitcoin Developers chatroom by an

<p>$$ C = v.H + k.G $$</p>
<p>The public key, \(P = k.G\) is known as the <em>public</em> spending key.</p>
<h2 id="synchronisationstate"><a class="header" href="#synchronisationstate">SynchronisationState</a></h2>
<p>The current synchronisation state of a <a href="Glossary.html#base-node" title="A full Tari node running on the base layer, validating and propagating Tari coin transactions
and blocks">Base Node</a>. This can either be</p>
<ul>
<li><code>starting</code> - The node has freshly started up and is still waiting for first round of chain_metadata responses from its 
neighbours on which to base its next state change.</li>
<li><code>header_sync</code> - The node is in the process of synchronising headers with chosen sync peer.</li>
<li><code>horizon_sync</code> - The node is in the process of syncing blocks from the tip to its [pruning horizon]</li>
<li><code>block_sync</code> -   The node is in the process of syncing all blocks back to the genesis block</li>
<li><code>listening</code> - The node has completed its syncing strategy and will continue to listen for new blocks and monitor
its neighbours to detect if it falls behind.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="synchronisationstrategy"><a class="header" href="#synchronisationstrategy">SynchronisationStrategy</a></h2>
<p>The generalised approach for a <a href="Glossary.html#base-node" title="A full Tari node running on the base layer, validating and propagating Tari coin transactions

<h2 id="tariscript-3"><a class="header" href="#tariscript-3">TariScript</a></h2>
<p>Tari uses a scripting system for transactions, not unlike <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script">Bitcoin's scripting system</a>,
called TariScript. It is also simple, stack-based, processed from left to right, not Turing-complete, with no loops. It
is a list of instructions linked in a non malleable way to each output, specifying its conditions of spending.</p>
<h2 id="transaction"><a class="header" href="#transaction">Transaction</a></h2>
<p>Transactions are activities recorded on the Tari <a href="Glossary.html#blockchain" title="The linked sequence of Tari blocks on the Tari base layer">blockchain</a> running on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer" title="The Tari layer handling payments and secured by proof of work">base layer</a>. Transactions always involve a
transfer of <a href="Glossary.html#tari-coin" title="The base layer token">Tari coin</a>s. A <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">mimblewimble</a> transaction body consists of one or more blinded inputs and outputs.</p>

<h2 id="unspent-transaction-outputs"><a class="header" href="#unspent-transaction-outputs">Unspent transaction outputs</a></h2>
<p>An unspent transaction output (UTXO) is a discrete number of Tari that are available to be spent. The sum of all
UTXOs represents all the Tari currently in circulation. In addition, the sum of all UTXO values equals the sum of the
<a href="Glossary.html#block-reward" title="The amount of Tari created in every block">block reward</a>s for all blocks up to the current block height.</p>
<p>UTXO values are hidden by their <a href="Glossary.html#commitment">commitment</a>s. Only the owner of the UTXO and (presumably) the creator of the UTXO
(either a <a href="Glossary.html#coinbase-transaction">Coinbase transaction</a> or previous spender) know the value of the UTXO.</p>
